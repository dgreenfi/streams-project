See CA Proposition 215, SB 420 &amp; CA Health &amp; Safety Code11362.5, 11362.7.</p>\n<p>Medical cannabis (also referred to as medical marijuana) refers to the use of Cannabis (marijuana), including constituents of cannabis, THC and other cannabinoids, as a physician-recommended form of medicine or herbal therapy. Cannabis has a long history of medicinal use, with evidence dating back to 2,000 B.C.E.</p>\n<p>Although the extent of the medicinal value of cannabis has been disputed, it does have several well-documented beneficial effects. Among these are: the amelioration of nausea and vomiting, stimulation of hunger in chemotherapy and AIDS patients, lowered intraocular eye pressure (shown to be effective for treating glaucoma), as well as general analgesic effects (pain reliever). Less confirmed individual studies also have been conducted indicating cannabis is beneficial in a variety of conditions including Multiple sclerosis and depression. Synthetic cannabinoids are also available as prescription drugs in many countries. Examples include Marinol, available in Germany and the United States, and Cesamet, available in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and also in the United States.</p>\n<p>There are several methods for administration of dosage, including vaporizing or smoking dried buds, drinking or eating extracts, and taking capsules. The comparable efficacy of these methods was the subject of an investigative study conducted by the National Institutes of Health.</p>\n<p>While cannabis for recreational use is illegal in most parts of the world, its use as a medicine is legal in a number of territories worldwide, including Canada, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Israel, Italy, Finland, and Portugal. In the United States, federal law outlaws all cannabis use, while permission for medical cannabis varies among states. Distribution is usually done within a framework defined by local laws.

The \"green rush\" is coming and there will be tremendous entrepreneual opportunities to capitalize on! We are more than promoting the legalization of recreational use of&nbsp;cannabis in California, we also meet up on hikes, 420 events, 420 parties&nbsp;etc. You can also&nbsp;volunteer with the 2016 Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA) which is the initiative in California that will be on the November 2016 ballot that will legalize cannabis for adult use recreationally. It's important that the facts, truth and science be known to everyone on the highly successful rollout of Colorado legalizing cannabis for recreational use 3 years ago. Here are some facts(please look these up for yourself). Teen use of marijuana in Colorado since recreational legalization has&nbsp;decreased 3.8%(source: colo dept of health.gov) and the federal government also has&nbsp;stated that teen use dropped 3% since recreational legalization in colorado&nbsp;as well(source:&nbsp;CDC&nbsp;Center of Disease Control and youth prevention website). Everyone said \"you legalize pot and all&nbsp;the kids will be lighting up\". This ridiculous&nbsp;propaganda has been proven wrong.&nbsp;JAMA internal medicine has reported that in states where marijuana is available, prescription drug deaths have dropped by 25%. Tax revenue generated&nbsp;was so significant in Colorado that they&nbsp;reimbursed every Colorado citizen $7.68 on their tax return(Colorado state law when the tax revenue exceeds a certain amount). DUI's are down. Pot arrests are down.&nbsp;Unemployment in Colorado is the lowest in the nation as a result of this new emerging industry. These are exciting times and you are in the middle of experiencing the emergence of a whole new industry. There is lots of money to be made and a lot of fun to have. Recreational legalization of marijuana is a cultural force that cannot be stopped!

What can you come up with? the possibilities are endless so I'm looking for oil lovers with a passion&nbsp;for extraction to come create new and&nbsp;exciting product possibilities.&nbsp;We will bring the appliance,&nbsp;some plants, some herbs, some fruit, and who knows what else.&nbsp;Members are encouraged to bring fun things to test as well. You can come see how it works and make your own&nbsp;oils to&nbsp;share.&nbsp;Lets make magic together</p>", "join_mode": "open", "who": "cannabis lovers", "visibility": "public", "photos": [{"photo_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/5/6/0/600_444737760.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/5/6/0/thumb_444737760.jpeg", "id": 444737760, "highres_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/5/6/0/highres_444737760.jpeg"}], "group_photo": {"photo_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/5/6/0/600_444737760.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/5/6/0/thumb_444737760.jpeg", "id": 444737760, "highres_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/5/6/0/highres_444737760.jpeg"}, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/marijuana-essential-oil-extraction-in-longmont/", "members": 66, "lat": 40.17, "urlname": "marijuana-essential-oil-extraction-in-longmont", "name": "marijuana essential oil extraction in longmont", "created": 1449246243000, "country": "US", "localized_country_name": "USA"}

I want to make that opportunity available to other Moms. For Moms who don\u2019t or feel they can\u2019t tell the people in their world that they use cannabis. We are here for you ladies, you are not alone. As for you Moms who are out and proud, good for you! You are an inspiration to Moms who live our lifestyle. Regarding me, I am a married Mom of four, legally medicating in San Diego, California. I am continuing my education, in life as well as in the Cannabis Industry, and want to share that information with other Mothers. For example; practical information that is relevant to being a Parent or Caregiver, exposure to new technology and products, incredible and interesting information about cannabis and the Industry itself, medical advances and even social events for fun!

This is for those who believe in ending the New Jim Crow. &nbsp; <br> <br>This is also a group dedicated to statistical based arguments rather than hyperbole or sensationalism. <br> <br>Yes, heroin and methamphetamine are dangerous and very addictive drugs, but the drug war against them and other drugs cause way more social harms than the drugs themselves. We can look to progressive cities, states, countries such as Vancouver B.C., Colorado, Washington, and Portugal for inspiration. Decriminalization of cannabis and even cocaine and heroin is not enough as that leaves the black market in place which still allows for unrestricted access to minors, predatory drug sales, violence, reduced but still continued mass incarceration of minorities (due to racial profiling and imprisonment of disadvantaged minorities who join the drug game but get caught at a higher rate than their peers who are not minorities), animosity towards police in urban communities, ruined lives due to childhood errors in judgement and lack of opportunity (due to a criminal record for those youth who sell drugs and are caught), etc. <br> <br>We will start by organizing activities to gather signatures for the 4 ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana as well as to register citizens to vote at various locations throughout Massachusetts (signature collection and voter registration tables at grocery stores, at concerts, etc.). I need help from those who are like minded and who are interested in voter registration and drug policy reform and activism. <br> <br>If you are new to this topic, books to consider reading would be The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander, High Price: A Neuroscientist's Journey of Self-Discovery That Challenges Everything You Know About Drugs and Society by Carl Hart, Our Right To Drugs: The Case for a Free Market Paperback by Thomas Szasz, Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs Hardcover by Johann Hari, Saying Yes by Jacob Sullum, and&nbsp;http://www.npr.org/2015/09/14/440327585/ta-nehisi-coates-outlines-path-to-mass-incarceration-in-the-atlantic<br> <br>Another idea would be to have some book club meetings to read some of the above books as well as others that are of interest to the members of this meetup. This is not so much a social group as a group that is dedicated to actual action. <br> <br>Let's start with reform around cannabis and after that is achieved let's start advocating for change around other drugs. &nbsp;Too many people are losing friends and family to prison and to drug overdose in our state.</p>", "created": 1442329638000, "country": "US", "join_mode": "open", "lon": -71.07, "visibility": "public_limited", "localized_country_name": "USA", "state": "MA", "score": 2712.0, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/Working-to-end-the-New-Jim-Crow-in-Massachusetts/", "members": 76, "timezone": "US/Eastern", "lat": 42.35, "urlname": "Working-to-end-the-New-Jim-Crow-in-Massachusetts", "organizer": {"bio": "", "photo": {"photo_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/1/6/1/member_249773601.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/1/6/1/thumb_249773601.jpeg", "id": 249773601, "highres_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/1/6/1/highres_249773601.jpeg"}, "id": 34991262, "name": "Mark"}, "id": 18934392, "name": "Working to end the New Jim Crow in Massachusetts"}

In our short time as an organization we have successfully educated the Vallejo City Council on the many benefits of cannabis, we were instrumental in passing the first successful referendum in Vallejo history. That referendum put a stop to an ordinance signed by the City Council that would have shut down all of the medical cannabis dispensaries in Vallejo for an undetermined amount of time and then would have reopened just four dispensaries that would have been handpicked by the Vallejo Police Department. After the success of that referendum the City Council sat down with the cannabis industry in Vallejo, as well as citizens of Vallejo and came up with a much better ordinance that grandfathered in the pre-moratorium, licensed tax-paying dispensaries. Together the patients of Vallejo have made a huge impact in our community. We wish the fight was over and the stigma behind using cannabis as medicine did not exist anymore but it does still exist, so our work is far from over. The VPC is committed to educating the community on the realities and benefits of medical cannabis.

Never before has the human species faced a challenge quite like that posed by the vastly diverse varieties of the Cannabis Plant. </p> \n<p>I don't see this as a competition but a diversification for the good of all involved, but for historical and clandestine reasons the recreational strains and varieties and ingestion methods are off to a big head start, an unavoidable and entirely fun effect of decades of effort by citizen scientist working entirely outside of the law, where high yields and recreational intoxication, appealing aroma and taste are the goals that must be pursued to guarantee survival of the old school clandestine grow. But the spectrum of the Cannabis experience is drastically more diverse than the variety of plants, products and therapies currently available.</p> \n<p>Simultaneous to the growing acceptance of recreational cannabis, there is a complimentary groundswell of a different nature starting to take form. Comprised not of cannabis doubters, but those that doubt we are experiencing even a fraction of the plants full potential as the current state of the Marijuanna art is still suffering from a lack of a Scientific *body of evidence* to support the efforts that growers and processors boldly dedicate themselves to on a daily basis. </p> \n<p>If you doubt my assertion, that the best among us are flying blind, I pose a metaphor. Have you ever eaten a sausage? If not, do you fully understand where it came from? Did you not have the stomach to even look? I would implore you to consider the fact that you should do it anyway. Well... having \"been there\" I can assure you that science, ALL science is the exact same way. If you have a sciencey sounding idea and you don't know where it came from, you're a customer, not a chef. Worse in the scientific area (which is fully accessible to everyone) it's worse... it's Junk Science, which is the worst cancer on any body of knowledge, where weed is no exception. </p> \n<p>So... with no book to look up the answer in, no special version of google or youtube to search... who, oh who is to step up and fill the gap? </p> \n<p><b>I'm literally asking.

Additionally, he has introduced bills that would provide tax credits for American families to help pay for education expenses.)&nbsp; Paul has asserted that he does not think there should be any federal control over education and education should be handled at a local and state level.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n Would end the unconstitutional \"War on Drugs\" and decriminalize all drugs.&nbsp; He instead believes drug addicts deserve compassion and rehabilitation, not an endless, costly, and dehumanizing prison industry.&nbsp; Ron Paul intoruced HR 2306 \"The Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2011\", the first legislation of its kind in Congress, would repeal federal penalties for production, distribution, and possession of the drug, leaving the states free to address the issue as they see fit.</p>\n<p>Abortion; Paul has said that the ninth and tenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution do not grant the federal government any authority to legalize or ban abortion, stating that \"the federal government has no authority whatsoever to involve itself in the abortion issue.\"</p>\n<p>Gay marriage; Paul opposes all federal efforts to define marriage, whether defined as a union between one man and one woman, or defined as including anything else as well. He believes that recognizing or legislating marriages should be left to the states, and not subjected to \"judicial activism\".&nbsp; He has stated that in a best case scenario, governments would enforce contracts and grant divorces but otherwise have no say in marriage. Paul has also stated he doesn't want to interfere in the free association of two individuals in a social, sexual, and religious sense.&nbsp; Additionally, when asked if he was supportive of gay marriage Paul responded \"I am supportive of all voluntary associations and people can call it whatever they want.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Right to keep and bear arms</strong>;<br>\n\n<br>\n\n The only 2008 presidential candidate to earn Gun Owners of America's A+ rating, Paul has been a lead sponsor of legislation in Congress attempting to maintain individual Second Amendment rights. He has also fought for the right of pilots to be armed.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n In the first chapter of his book, Freedom Under Siege, Paul argued that the purpose of the Second Amendment is to place a check on government tyranny, not to merely grant hunting rights or allow self-defense. When asked whether individuals should be allowed to own machine guns, Paul responded, \"Whether it's an automatic weapon or not is, I think, irrelevant.\" Paul believes that a weapons ban at the federal or state level does not work either. \"Of course true military-style automatic rifles remain widely available to criminals on the black market. So practically speaking, the assault weapons ban does nothing to make us safer.\" Rather, he sees school shootings, plane hijackings, and other such events as a result of prohibitions on self-defense.</p>\n<p><strong>Electability</strong>:</p>\n<p>Has previously won 14 elections for Congress</p>\n<p>Has won the last 2 CPAC straw polls</p>\n<p>\"Grandfather\" of the Tea Party (In 2007 the grassroots raised $6.04 in the \"Tea Party 07\" money bomb, breaking records for the most of any candidates 1 day donations.)</p>\n<p>April 14 2011 Rasmussen poll puts Ron Paul 1% behind Obama in a head to head match up(41% vs. 42%. respectively), better then any other GOP contender.</p>\n<p>In Q1 2011, raised $3 million, more then any other candidate in that quarter</p>\n<p>Raised over $1 million in 24 hours on May 5th, during the first GOP debate of 2011.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other positions are prevalent on Youtube and wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Ron_Paul</p>\n<p><strong>Related sites</strong>;</p>\n<p>http://www.ronpaul2012.com/who-is-ron-paul/</p>\n<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCM_wQy4YVg</p>\n<p>http://www.downsizedc.org</p>\n<p>http://www.NaturalNews.com</p>\n<p>http://www.LewRockwell.com</p>\n<p>http://www.Mises.org</p>\n<p>http://www.campaignforliberty.com/</p>\n<p>http://www.ronpaulforums.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "created": 1305603653000, "country": "US", "join_mode": "open", "lon": -77.1, "visibility": "public_limited", "localized_country_name": "USA", "state": "MD", "score": 1689.0, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/The-Montgomery-Ron-Paul-2012-Meetup/", "members": 150, "timezone": "US/Eastern", "lat": 38.98, "urlname": "The-Montgomery-Ron-Paul-2012-Meetup", "organizer": {"bio": "", "photo": {"photo_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/4/9/8/member_41405272.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/4/9/8/thumb_41405272.jpeg", "id": 41405272, "highres_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/4/9/8/highres_41405272.jpeg"}, "id": 5222463, "name": "Candice"}, "id": 1871811, "group_photo": {"photo_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/f/1/600_25335601.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/f/1/thumb_25335601.jpeg", "id": 25335601, "highres_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/f/1/highres_25335601.jpeg"}, "name": "Montgomery County Liberty / Ron Paul Meetup"}

It was founded in 2002 by a group of five retired police officers. It has grown substantially and we now have thousands of members in over eighty countries.</p>\n<p>The mission of LEAP is to reduce the multitude of harms resulting from fighting the war on drugs and to lessen the incidence of death, disease, crime, and addiction by ultimately ending drug prohibition.</p>\n<p>Anyone can join LEAP but only current or former law enforcement officers can speak publicly for the organization. LEAP representatives have fought in the trenches of the War on Drugs and we know that prohibition is not working.</p>\n<p>LEAP's goals are:</p>\n<p>(1) To educate the public, the media, and policy makers about the failure of current drug policy by presenting a true picture of the history, causes and effects of drug use and the elevated crime rates more properly related to drug prohibition than to drug pharmacology; and</p>\n<p>(2) To restore the public's respect for police, which has been greatly diminished by law enforcements involvement in imposing drug prohibition.</p>\n<p>LEAP's main strategy for accomplishing these goals is to create a constantly growing speakers bureau staffed with knowledgeable and articulate former drug-warriors who describe the impact of current drug policies on: police/community relations; the safety of law enforcement officers and suspects; police corruption and misconduct; and the excessive financial and human costs associated with current drug policies.</p>\n<p><strong><em>ABOUT LEAP IN CANADA</em></strong></p>\n<p>ANYONE can join LEAP and we would not exist today without the dedicated help provided by many civilian volunteers. If you are passionate and professional in your support for drug policy reform, this is the place for you!</p>\n<p>We are seeking Canadian volunteers who are willing to assist with the following tasks:</p>\n<p>- Recruiting current and former members of law enforcement into the LEAP speakers bureau.</p>\n<p>- Fundraising.</p>\n<p>- Assisting with communications (media monitoring, research, rapid response, drafting and editing LEAP materials).</p>\n<p>- Accurately translating LEAP materials into other languages (particularly French, although other languages are welcome).</p>\n<p>- Booking engagements for LEAP speakers (eg. radio gigs, Rotary Club presentations, conferences, etc).</p>\n<p>- Developing offline support and awareness of the organization.</p>\n<p>If you want to end drug prohibition, please join this meetup group! LEAP is a \"big tent\" organization and we welcome folks from across the political spectrum. This includes the Conservatives, Liberals, NDP, Green Party and Bloc-Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois. The arguments in favour of drug policy reform apply to both the right and the left.</p>\n<p>We will schedule our first meeting once enough members join the group. Dress for the meetings will be business casual as we would like to create a professional, friendly atmosphere. Initially we plan to meet in the Vancouver area, but as the organization grows in Canada we will start meeting in other cities as well.</p>", "created": 1282090140000, "country": "CA", "join_mode": "open", "lon": -123.12, "visibility": "public", "localized_country_name": "Canada", "state": "BC", "score": 1685.0, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/leap-canada/", "members": 57, "timezone": "Canada/Pacific", "lat": 49.28, "urlname": "leap-canada", "organizer": {"bio": "", "photo": {"thumb_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/2/6/4/thumb_10549764.jpeg", "id": 10549764, "photo_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/2/6/4/member_10549764.jpeg"}, "id": 12790810, "name": "Steve Finlay"}, "id": 1692636, "group_photo": {"photo_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/2/a/600_17285162.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/2/a/thumb_17285162.jpeg", "id": 17285162, "highres_link": "http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/2/a/highres_17285162.jpeg"}, "name": "Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (Canada)"}

Assisting others begins with assisting yourself! <br> <br> During meetings, learn about activations, their purpose, how they are beneficial, create connections with those authentically interested in their own path being aligned with truth and Who They Are.&nbsp; Meetings can generally consist of activators sharing activations when time shows convenience to do so, for love donations. We also discuss ethics and other choices that allow you to be the best version of yourself you can be. <br></p>\n<p>Prerequisite for in-person meetups: AT LEAST 48 hours of ZERO alcohol consumption and drug-use. This includes plant medicines, marijuana, and tobacco.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>I am excited to share with you opportunity for self-empowered healing potentials. Take each step with activations as a step closer to your divinity. In these meet-up groups, we will get to know what activations are, how they can assist, why they are on Love Donation only, and how they are an important key to self-empowered self-realization, self-understanding, and finding your truths through your source, with some outside guidance. Activations allow us to access higher dimensions of understanding and clarity in ways most healing modalities do not have room/time for. Activations are remotely sent and received (at least in 2 separate rooms, with one door between the rooms at least), and are offered on Love Donation only. This means the receiver chooses the value of each Activation received. There are different names for many different types of activations: because each one illuminates a different aspect of Who You Are, so that YOU can take the time to energetically clear and resolve what deeper healing is ready to take place. Each one offers grace and ease in the process and requires extensive inner-work and large levels of commitment to be able to achieve writing one. Learn how to receive, learn how to send, and potentially even learn how to write activations if this is your true calling. </p>\n<br>", "created": 1454140335000, "country": "US", "join_mode": "open", "lon": -97.05, "visibility": "public", "localized_country_name": "USA", "next_event": {"yes_rsvp_count": 2, "utc_offset": -18000000, "time": 1461889800000, "id": "230234602", "name": "Center for Expansion (Grand Opening)"}, "state": "TX", "score": 1637.0, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/Activation-Station/", "members": 14, "timezone": "US/Central", "lat": 33.08, "urlname": "Activation-Station", "organizer": {"bio": "", "photo": {"photo_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/4/2/member_250318690.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/4/2/thumb_250318690.jpeg", "id": 250318690, "highres_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/5/4/2/highres_250318690.jpeg"}, "id": 193745724, "name": "Jennifer Earnest"}, "id": 19464623, "name": "Activation Station"}

The main role of a neuropsychologist is to help verify a specific diagnosis, identify strengths and weaknesses related to thinking and learning, and propose the most optimal treatment interventions or accommodations.</p>\n<p><b>What does a neuropsychologist do?\u00a0</b></p>\n<p>Neuropsychologist can be found in multiple settings such as hospitals, schools, private practices, and clinics. Neuropsychologists perform diagnostic assessments, provide/design treatment, or suggest accommodations for individuals who may have difficulties with attention, learning, behavior, emotional control, neurological issues, or developmental diseases just to name a few. \u00a0</p>\n<p><b>What does a neuropsychological evaluation tell you?</b></p>\n<p>A neuropsychological evaluation assists in better understanding an individual\u2019s function in areas such as memory, thinking skills, attention, perception, coordination, language, emotions, and personality.</p>\n<p><b>Who is assessed?</b></p>\n<p>Neuropsychologists typically assess people who are concerned with some aspects of their thinking skills. These concerns may be related to:</p>\n<p>(1)\u00a0 a specific medical concern, such as concussions, epilepsy, or autism</p>\n<p>(2)\u00a0 learning issues such as reading problems, math issues, or attention deficits</p>\n<p>(3)\u00a0 possible progressive disorders, such as dementia</p>\n<p>(4)\u00a0 helping to verify if a specific treatment plan has any potential side effects on thinking and/or behavior.</p>\n<p>In addition, neuropsychologists occasionally see children and adults to assess possible giftedness and /or try to establish a specific profile of strengths and weaknesses. These types of assessments are used to guide future career paths or design the most optimal learning strategies for a person.\u00a0</p>\n<br>", "created": 1402250274000, "country": "US", "join_mode": "open", "lon": -87.67, "visibility": "public", "localized_country_name": "USA", "state": "IL", "score": 1637.0, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/Neuropsychology-Brain-Fanatics/", "members": 95, "timezone": "US/Central", "lat": 41.97, "urlname": "Neuropsychology-Brain-Fanatics", "organizer": {"bio": "", "photo": {"photo_link": "http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/2/d/e/8/member_138911752.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/2/d/e/8/thumb_138911752.jpeg", "id": 138911752, "highres_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/2/d/e/8/highres_138911752.jpeg"}, "id": 3091817, "name": "Marty Clemons"}, "id": 14955772, "name": "Neuropsychology Brain Fanatics"}

This group was originally started to focus on the cannabis industry where at the time I was running a couple businesses, some successful and some not, but through this process I realized I was much more passionate about self development and growth, utilizing a variety of practices to continually work on improving myself and how I learn to deal with stress and this evolving world around us. Our \"Habits\" is one of the focuses of my work, whether thats trying to taper down on the coffee consumption or thinking about the over use of the digital \"time thieves\" in my life aka Iphone/computer. Having thought a lot about this and how it would be really great to create a forum for people to discuss how we balance our habits, stress, life/work. I spent some time researching online and realized there wasn't really much support in this area that wasn't too heavily weighed down by dogma and negative enforcing belief systems(AA, NA as examples). We live in a world filled with habits and addictions, our brains are literally wired to take the path of least resistance, so when it comes to balancing our habits, it can take work and I believe that we are all connected and that this work happens when we come together and share our experiences. I don't want this to be a mistaken as a \"recovery\" group, thats not what I am going for, but I do want to be able to offer support in those area, but stripped away of the taboos that can often come with our personal struggles to balance our habits in our day to day existence. I think when we reduce stress and find balance within our habits we can achieve so much. If you are interested in these topics, please lets meet up, explore and discuss.. alchemy, plant medicine, mindfullness, meditation, cannabis, biohacking, self improvement, herbs, nature, addiction, health, wellness, personal growth, artistic expression, venom therapy, exploring consciousness through varied techniques, nueroplasticity, the list goes on..</p>", "join_mode": "open", "who": "Life Path Seekers", "visibility": "public", "photos": [{"photo_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/e/d/600_448813549.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/e/d/thumb_448813549.jpeg", "id": 448813549, "highres_link": "http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/e/d/highres_448813549.jpeg"}], "group_photo": {"photo_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/e/d/600_448813549.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/e/d/thumb_448813549.jpeg", "id": 448813549, "highres_link": "http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/e/d/highres_448813549.jpeg"}, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-LGBTQ-Balancing-Habits-Plant-Medicine-Life/", "members": 93, "lat": 47.54, "urlname": "Seattle-LGBTQ-Balancing-Habits-Plant-Medicine-Life", "name": "Seattle Balancing Habits/Plant Medicine/Life experience", "created": 1414556765000, "country": "US", "localized_country_name": "USA"}

Come experience an environment where I will expose you to the latest science and emotional skills for dealing with substance use. And we'll have FUN. No speeches, sermons, lectures or rules. We come together recognizing supporting growth, fun, healing, medicine and consciousness is the goal.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n For some this is abstinence; for others it means 6 drinks of alcohol per week; for others, it means doing Mushrooms with a Shaman. JOIN US for an environment where everyone is allowed your own journey. And we all help each other. The 12 traditions in AA are very helpful for us, as a guide for how to treat each other. TRY IT, it's the new wave....We'll have support group meetups...and socials...and, eventually, expert speakers.</p>\n<p>Suggested Reading:<br>\n\n<br>\n\n The Truth About Addiction and Recovery, by Dr. Stanton Peele<br>\n\n Over the Influence, by Pat Denning and others<br>\n\n Alcoholics Anonymous, by Bill Wilson and Others<br>\n\n HARM Reduction Psychotherapy, by Dr. Andrew Tatarsky<br>\n\n<br>\n\n ALSO, YOUTUBE the above people and watch their videos and interviews.

See CA Proposition 215, SB 420 &amp; CA Health &amp; Safety Code11362.5, 11362.7.</p>\n<p>Medical cannabis (also referred to as medical marijuana) refers to the use of Cannabis (marijuana), including constituents of cannabis, THC and other cannabinoids, as a physician-recommended form of medicine or herbal therapy. Cannabis has a long history of medicinal use, with evidence dating back to 2,000 B.C.E.</p>\n<p>Although the extent of the medicinal value of cannabis has been disputed, it does have several well-documented beneficial effects. Among these are: the amelioration of nausea and vomiting, stimulation of hunger in chemotherapy and AIDS patients, lowered intraocular eye pressure (shown to be effective for treating glaucoma), as well as general analgesic effects (pain reliever). Less confirmed individual studies also have been conducted indicating cannabis is beneficial in a variety of conditions including Multiple sclerosis and depression. Synthetic cannabinoids are also available as prescription drugs in many countries. Examples include Marinol, available in Germany and the United States, and Cesamet, available in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and also in the United States.</p>\n<p>There are several methods for administration of dosage, including vaporizing or smoking dried buds, drinking or eating extracts, and taking capsules. The comparable efficacy of these methods was the subject of an investigative study conducted by the National Institutes of Health.</p>\n<p>While cannabis for recreational use is illegal in most parts of the world, its use as a medicine is legal in a number of territories worldwide, including Canada, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Israel, Italy, Finland, and Portugal. In the United States, federal law outlaws all cannabis use, while permission for medical cannabis varies among states. Distribution is usually done within a framework defined by local laws.

The \"green rush\" is coming and there will be tremendous entrepreneual opportunities to capitalize on! We are more than promoting the legalization of recreational use of&nbsp;cannabis in California, we also meet up on hikes, 420 events, 420 parties&nbsp;etc. You can also&nbsp;volunteer with the 2016 Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA) which is the initiative in California that will be on the November 2016 ballot that will legalize cannabis for adult use recreationally. It's important that the facts, truth and science be known to everyone on the highly successful rollout of Colorado legalizing cannabis for recreational use 3 years ago. Here are some facts(please look these up for yourself). Teen use of marijuana in Colorado since recreational legalization has&nbsp;decreased 3.8%(source: colo dept of health.gov) and the federal government also has&nbsp;stated that teen use dropped 3% since recreational legalization in colorado&nbsp;as well(source:&nbsp;CDC&nbsp;Center of Disease Control and youth prevention website). Everyone said \"you legalize pot and all&nbsp;the kids will be lighting up\". This ridiculous&nbsp;propaganda has been proven wrong.&nbsp;JAMA internal medicine has reported that in states where marijuana is available, prescription drug deaths have dropped by 25%. Tax revenue generated&nbsp;was so significant in Colorado that they&nbsp;reimbursed every Colorado citizen $7.68 on their tax return(Colorado state law when the tax revenue exceeds a certain amount). DUI's are down. Pot arrests are down.&nbsp;Unemployment in Colorado is the lowest in the nation as a result of this new emerging industry. These are exciting times and you are in the middle of experiencing the emergence of a whole new industry. There is lots of money to be made and a lot of fun to have. Recreational legalization of marijuana is a cultural force that cannot be stopped!

Together I want us to create an atmosphere of safety, respect, generosity and helpfulness. I partly want to enable people to enjoy the fun, easy, productive plant that cannabis can be. I also want to help empower those with medical needs to control their own medicine - from production at home to processing, extraction and storage. We stand to gain much by leveraging cheap homegrown cannabis. Among other things, it helps to reduce our dependency on for-profit pharmaceuticals, the black market created by prohibition, and the commercial cannabis industry.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This is not a public forum, but remember that it isn't totally private either.&nbsp; Guidelines for both our in-person meetings and online discussion<br><br>* Help each other, be a good listener<br><br>* Think carefully before sharing any information with anyone in the group, whether online or at an in-person meetup.

This group is about creating depth experiences, with the focus on the experience itself rather than cannabis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My background is in outdoor guiding and using the power of nature to heal people in a psychological context. After working in this capacity I recognized that everything was different in the context of nature. This meet-up group creates community for the experiences, though while you are using cannabis the experience is designed to be a personal one.</p>\n<p>Cannabis intensifies the present moment, feelings, thoughts and senses, which for most people results in an inward pull psychologically. Having an environment that helps to expand and intensify this state is vital for deepening the experience. The setting is crucial for the experience to take hold. Bringing back what your experience meant to you is a powerful way to anchor everything. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The intention behind creating this group is to have a container where you can explore the high on your own terms. We do this in expansive natural areas so that presence is reflected everywhere without the concept of judgement from others. We set a social area where people can talk and where there are people to help you if you start to have a difficult experience, but outside of this area we ask people to respect each other by keeping silence.&nbsp;<span>We hope to hold a solid ratio of facilitators, those who hold the container and help with real world interactions, while the explorers flow through the underworld. We will consider this ratio in accordance to group size.</span></p>\n<p><span>Some specifics: &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>-<b>This group is obviously only for those 21 and over</b>. No exceptions. Sorry if it speaks to you and you aren't of age, but we can't jeopardize the group by going outside of the law in this way.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-We will be going out into some beautiful natural areas. Whether we stay there overnight or we just go for the day, the experiences we will be trying to deliver are meant to be held in a beautiful, peaceful natural area. <b>Anyone is welcome regardless of outdoor experience</b>, but if you have strong aversion to wild nature the initial few times may be a challenge for you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-<b>The Experience does not belong to&nbsp;any single specific spiritual way of viewing things</b>.&nbsp;When one enters the depths it is difficult not to relate that to the language that one has around spirituality. All language regarding spirituality is welcome, if you chose to speak in such terms, though we do ask you to keep your interpretations to yourself rather than placing your views of spirituality on someone else.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-<b>This is not a party or hook-up scene. </b>We have had some people come out and express this, and if that is your primary motivation then it could jeopardize the atmosphere of the depth experience. If you would feel safer with some type of buddy system, that is something that members can work out together either before or during the trip.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Finally,<b> the focus of this group is the depth experience</b>. Nature and cannabis help to bring this forward, but they are not the focus. Specifically, I feel it needs to be stated that <b>cannabis is not the focal point of this community. It isn't even required that you use. </b>If you can get to such levels of depth without using, by all means.

This is to include: Step-mothers, LGBT Mothers &amp;amp; Guardians. I have started CannaMomsClub, San Diego for the purpose of providing a Social Support Group for Mothers who utilize Medical marijuana, aka Cannabis, in their lifestyle. This group\u2019s intention is that of providing a safe space for like-minded individuals to support and learn from one another. Meeting frequency and locations are still TBD. This is a brand new venture so please be tolerant/patient with me. As a Mom who uses cannabis I recently found myself in the position of meeting and networking with a lot of folks in the Cannabis Industry. I have a passion for advocacy and cannabis making this group feel like a natural move at this time. I have kept my medicating hidden for many years; Imagine how liberating it was to come work in this industry and to be surrounded by so many supportive people. I want to make that opportunity available to other Moms. For Moms who don\u2019t or feel they can\u2019t tell the people in their world that they use cannabis. We are here for you ladies, you are not alone. As for you Moms who are out and proud, good for you! You are an inspiration to Moms who live our lifestyle. Regarding me, I am a married Mom of four, legally medicating in San Diego, California. I am continuing my education, in life as well as in the Cannabis Industry, and want to share that information with other Mothers. For example; practical information that is relevant to being a Parent or Caregiver, exposure to new technology and products, incredible and interesting information about cannabis and the Industry itself, medical advances and even social events for fun!

In our short time as an organization we have successfully educated the Vallejo City Council on the many benefits of cannabis, we were instrumental in passing the first successful referendum in Vallejo history. That referendum put a stop to an ordinance signed by the City Council that would have shut down all of the medical cannabis dispensaries in Vallejo for an undetermined amount of time and then would have reopened just four dispensaries that would have been handpicked by the Vallejo Police Department. After the success of that referendum the City Council sat down with the cannabis industry in Vallejo, as well as citizens of Vallejo and came up with a much better ordinance that grandfathered in the pre-moratorium, licensed tax-paying dispensaries. Together the patients of Vallejo have made a huge impact in our community. We wish the fight was over and the stigma behind using cannabis as medicine did not exist anymore but it does still exist, so our work is far from over. The VPC is committed to educating the community on the realities and benefits of medical cannabis.

But the spectrum of the Cannabis experience is drastically more diverse than the variety of plants, products and therapies currently available.</p> \n<p>Simultaneous to the growing acceptance of recreational cannabis, there is a complimentary groundswell of a different nature starting to take form. Comprised not of cannabis doubters, but those that doubt we are experiencing even a fraction of the plants full potential as the current state of the Marijuanna art is still suffering from a lack of a Scientific *body of evidence* to support the efforts that growers and processors boldly dedicate themselves to on a daily basis. </p> \n<p>If you doubt my assertion, that the best among us are flying blind, I pose a metaphor. Have you ever eaten a sausage? If not, do you fully understand where it came from? Did you not have the stomach to even look? I would implore you to consider the fact that you should do it anyway. Well... having \"been there\" I can assure you that science, ALL science is the exact same way. If you have a sciencey sounding idea and you don't know where it came from, you're a customer, not a chef. Worse in the scientific area (which is fully accessible to everyone) it's worse... it's Junk Science, which is the worst cancer on any body of knowledge, where weed is no exception. </p> \n<p>So... with no book to look up the answer in, no special version of google or youtube to search... who, oh who is to step up and fill the gap? </p> \n<p><b>I'm literally asking.

This group was originally started to focus on the cannabis industry where at the time I was running a couple businesses, some successful and some not, but through this process I realized I was much more passionate about self development and growth, utilizing a variety of practices to continually work on improving myself and how I learn to deal with stress and this evolving world around us. Our \"Habits\" is one of the focuses of my work, whether thats trying to taper down on the coffee consumption or thinking about the over use of the digital \"time thieves\" in my life aka Iphone/computer. Having thought a lot about this and how it would be really great to create a forum for people to discuss how we balance our habits, stress, life/work. I spent some time researching online and realized there wasn't really much support in this area that wasn't too heavily weighed down by dogma and negative enforcing belief systems(AA, NA as examples). We live in a world filled with habits and addictions, our brains are literally wired to take the path of least resistance, so when it comes to balancing our habits, it can take work and I believe that we are all connected and that this work happens when we come together and share our experiences. I don't want this to be a mistaken as a \"recovery\" group, thats not what I am going for, but I do want to be able to offer support in those area, but stripped away of the taboos that can often come with our personal struggles to balance our habits in our day to day existence. I think when we reduce stress and find balance within our habits we can achieve so much.

The legal protections that members of ONAC have under the US Constitution, the Freedom of Religion (1st Amendment), the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Person\u2019s Act (RLUIPA) were discussed and clarified. <br> <br>Attorney Charles W. Galbraith (of the prestigious Kilpatrick Townsend law firm) was the White House Associate Director of Inter-Governmental Affairs and Public Engagement. He was instrumental in drafting the policies that confirm that the Federal Government respects the sovereignty of Native American Tribes and their ability to choose if they want to grow and sell cannabis and other plants on the reservations. <br> <br>Galbraith emphatically declared that, by law, government agencies such as the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) the US Forestry Service and the Department of the Interior have no legal right or authority to mandate or restrict what is sacred land or what is or is not a sacrament (called medicine by many tribes). <br> <br>These sacraments (such as peyote, cannabis, san pedro, ayahuasca and many others) can be possessed and used by members in good standing of Native American Churches that meet the government defined requirements. At this time, the only large or broad based group that has been noted as meeting those requirements is Oklevueha NAC. These religious rights have been confirmed by a number of state, district and federal court cases including those brought before the Utah Supreme Court, US 9th Circuit Court, US 10th Appeals Court and the US Supreme Court. <br><a href=\"https://www.memberplanet.com/soulquest-retreat\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.memberplanet.com/soulquest-retr...</a> <br> <br>Here is the link for the full letter of recognition. <br><a href=\"http://nativeamericanchurches.org/meeting-in-washington-d-c-on-protecting-onac-members/\" class=\"linkified\">http://nativeamericanchurches.org/meeting-i...</a></p>\n<br>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>INFORMATION ABOUT OUR WEEKEND RETREATS&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We do not charge for the medicine, but for the work of accompaniment and supervision, for meals and accommodation, and for the translation of the facilitators from the country in which you are staying.</p>\n<p>To attend a ceromony everyone must be a Member of ONAC of Soul Quest INC, to become a member please click on the link&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.memberplanet.com%2Fsoulquest-retreat&amp;h=pAQF5YTBU&amp;enc=AZPl-i983dQQwY80ANBNFjjsdBEKvaftqrJNVC-HMLvrjfPMHyRUrNOdrIKb9DPZJvA&amp;s=1\">https://www.memberplanet.com/soulquest-retreat</a></p>\n<br>\n<p>WHAT TO BRING TO THE THE LOCATION</p>\n<p>Blanket, pillow, towel, comfortable warm cloths, water bottle</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>THERE ARE ONLY 15 SPOTS FOR THIS RETREAT</p>\n<p>Donations are as followed:</p>\n<p>Ayahuasca Ceremony: 150.00 per session min 2 nights&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Sananga Ceremony : free with yearly membership</span></p>\n<p>RAP\u00ca Ceremony : free with yearly membership</p>\n<p><span>Kamb\u00f4 Ceremony: $100.00 per session&nbsp;</span></p>\n<br>\n<p>AN UNIQUE EXPERIENCE:</p>\n<p>Soul Quest offers participation in Retreats for healing and personal evolution, with one of the most powerful shamanic medicines, and with a professional and psychotherapeutic approach that is reaching thousands of people from all over the world, providing conclusive answers and real solutions to their problems.</p>\n<p>These RETREATS, combining Sacred Plant Medicine and psychotherapy, are encounters for people seeking personal growth through the evolution of their consciousness. Bearing in mind that no human development is sustainable, unless it grows from the root, and that everything that is resolved at a deep level is maintained.</p>\n<p>This is a retreat because it is a \u201cresidential cohabitation\u201d and lasts in most cases 3 days and 2 nights, but it\u2019s also possible to come for just one night. It usually runs from Friday to Sunday, and there are 3 Sacred Plant Medicine sessions over the course of the weekend, with psycho- therapeutic work before and after each session. (In some cases there are retreats that lasts up to 11 days)</p>\n<br>\n<p>TARGET GROUP</p>\n<p>The participants at these retreats are mostly people who want to initiate, strengthen or complete processes of change, healing or transformation. There are people who understand the use of Sacred Plant Medicine as a process and therefore want to have a profound experience, consolidating it through an integration that requires a minimum of 3 days and 2 nights. And there are others who just want to have an encounter with Sacred Plant Medicine to experience its effect and experiment in a more limited way, like a first contact.</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>FOCUS OF THE WORK</p>\n<p>In this residential encounter we share a number of psycho- therapeutic approaches, group dynamics and psycho-emotional exercises that serve as preparation and integration for the Sacred Plant Medicine sessions being offered. As a whole, all the activities are aimed at awakening consciousness, overcoming limitations and encouraging the transformation of the life of every participant.</p>\n<p>The mode of \"cohabitation\" provides many moments during the retreat for opening inner spaces and working in depth on whatever arises; the surprise is the magic that allows what is hidden to spontaneously rise to the surface.</p>\n<p>THE FACILITATORS</p>\n<p>The accompaniment is professional and highly experienced. The facilitators are part of an international team who prepare permanently by visiting shamans and update themselves by conducting private retreats for their own training.</p>\n<p>The Soul Quest team has facilitators, therapists and collaborators from Spain, Argentina, Colombia, England, Switzerland, Italy, Venezuela USA and Germany.</p>\n<p>These retreats are guided and supervised by a minimum of 2 facilitators with extensive experience in profound work with Sacred Plant Medicine of great transformative power.</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>The Sacred Plant Medicine</p>\n<p>We use indigenous ancestral medicine of high quality and purity, which is of paramount importance for these processes, brought by members of the team from the Colombian and Brazilian jungle. The medicine is made by shamans in its place of origin with mature plants and using the traditional master formula, with nothing added or altered. We consider it risky to take equivalent plants or those that have additives intended to enhance its effects. The purity and quality of the Sacred Plant Medicine is very important for the healing processes we offer.</p>\n<p><span>Ayahuasca is an Amazonian plant mixture that is capable of inducing altered states of consciousness, usually lasting between 4 to 8 hours after ingestion. Ranging from mildly stimulating to extremely visionary, ayahuasca is used primarily as a medicine and as a shamanic means of communication, typically in a ceremonial session under the guidance of an experienced drinker.</span> <br></p>\n<p>The main ingredient of this jungle tea is a vine, Banisteriopsis caapi, which like the tea itself is also called ayahuasca (which means \u2018vine of the soul' or 'vine with a soul\u2019). The secondary ingredient is either chacruna (Psychotria viridis) or chagropanga (Diplopterys cabrerana), plants that contain a relatively high amount of the psychedelic substance DMT.</p>\n<p>Nobody knows for sure how long this drink has been used. First recorded Western contact with ayahuasca was made in 1851 by Richard Spruce, the famous ethnobotanist from England. When taking into account archeological evidence of comparable native plant use, it seems likely that its use dates back to at least two millennia ago.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Sananga Ceremony : $25.00 per session&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sananga is a very powerful sacred eye medicine, which is made from a shrub called \u201cApocynaceae\u201d from the Amazon jungle.</p>\n<p>The bark of this special shrub\u2019s root is used to make these sacred eye drops, which is traditionally used by the indigenous peoples to lift \u201cpanema\u201d \u2013 it can be thought of as bad luck, depression, laziness, sadness, or negative energetic influences, which attract difficulties and disease.</p>\n<p>Also, traditionally they use it for improving their hunting skills; in order to sharpen their sense perceptions and awareness whilst hunting in the Amazon jungle.</p>\n<p>The beautiful spirit of Sananga assists us to deeply cleanse on the energetic, physical, emotional, and spiritual levels. Also, it assists us to unblock, re-align, open-up all the chakras, and release any stuck energy and sickness.</p>\n<p>On the energetic level, Sananga profoundly helps to open-up the inner sight, third eye, visions, activates the pineal gland, clears any mental confusion, releases negative thoughts, and deeply cleanses the whole aura from the inside out.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>RAP\u00ca Ceremony : $25.00 per session&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rap\u00e9 is legal sacred shamanic snuff medicine, which is pronounced \u2018ha-peh\u2019 in English. Also, it\u2019s known to be casually referred to as \u2018hape\u2019, \u2018hapi\u2019 or \u2018rapay\u201d by some Western people.</p>\n<p>They are very rare, sacred, powerful, precious, profoundly healing and cleansing miracle medicines. They are made in a very sacred and labour intensive process, and consist of various Amazonian medicinal plants, trees, leaves, seeds, and other sacred ingredients. Some types of rap\u00e9 are made by various indigenous tribes, who originate from different South American countries \u2013 primarily Brazil and Peru.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, they are applied by using a pipe made from bamboo or bone, which is blown through each nostril on both sides. They can be self-administered using a V-shaped self-applicator pipe, which connects the mouth to the nostrils. Alternatively, the can be administered by another person using a blow pipe, which connects the blower\u2019s mouth to the other person\u2019s nostrils. The self-applicator pipe is known as \u2018Kuripe\u2019, and the blow pipe is know as a \u2018Tepi\u2019 in the Brazilian tradition.</p>\n<p>General suggestion is to use a pea sized amount (50% for each nostril) of medicine for beginners, and dosage can be increased after prolonged use of a specific rap\u00e9. Also, it\u2019s suggested that you use them within a quiet sacred space without any interruptions (optional sacred music playing) \u2013 sitting upright, either cross-legged or in a chair with eyes closed after application. Also, suggested slow breathing after application through the mouth/nose is very important. The use and application of our products is solely at the customer\u2019s responsibility.</p>\n<p>Generally, they have the following effects \u2013 profoundly helps to re-align and open all your chakras, improves your grounding, releases any sickness on physical, emotional, mental and spiritual levels, opens-up the third eye, de-calcifies the pineal gland, clears any mental confusion, releases any negative thoughts, removes any entities, connects you to your divine breath, and elevates your connection with Spirit.</p>\n<p>Please note that you may experience purging, vomiting, bowel movements and excess saliva, which is normal \u2013 where stuck energy, toxins and sickness are being released from your energetic and physical bodies. You may need a bucket, toilet tissue and drinking water close to hand.</p>\n<p>Each different type of rap\u00e9 has different vibrations, notes, qualities, subtleties, and very different effects on the energetic field. Furthermore, after you develop a deeper relationship with each rap\u00e9 \u2013 they are powerful Plant teacher spirits, where you can ask any questions or hold specific intentions for each sacred session.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, during Yawanawa, Kaxinawa-Huni Kuin and Katukina (Brazilian Indigenous tribes) ceremonies, they normally use Rap\u00e9 and Sananga eye medicine during Ayahuasca (aka- Uni or Nixi pae) ceremonies to help with purging, releasing sickness, moving any stuck energies, opening-up the visions and for clear sight.</p>\n<p>Storage: they need to be stored in airtight containers, such as plastic containers or jars with lids. Please keep away from wet, damp and humid conditions, and away from direct sunlight.</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>Kamb\u00f4 Ceremony: $100.00 per session&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kambo is a traditional Amazonian medicine derived from frogs, and is markedly different from hallucinogens such as ayahuasca and San Pedro. It\u2019s main use is for the treatment of chronic pain.</p>\n<p>Kambo is a secretion from the bright green giant monkey frog (Phyllomedusa bicolor\u2014also known as the giant leaf frog) that lives in the north-west area of the Amazon rain forest. Indigenous tribes have used it as a prophylactic against malaria, and also to boost strength and stamina. The frogs aren\u2019t injured from the collection of their secretions, which are obtained via scraping onto wooden \u201cKambo sticks\u201d.</p>\n<p>Kambo has been studied for its pharmacological potential and found to contain several peptides that trigger extreme reactions in human beings. These include the potent opioids Dermorphin and Deltorphin \u2014each many times stronger than morphine.</p>\n<p>In addition to powerful analgesic effects, this medicine has anti-inflammatory power; it can heal infections and regulate blood pressure. Other potential uses include treatment of depression, migraine, blood circulation problems, Alzheimers and Parkinson\u2019s disease, vascular insufficiency, organ diseases, cancer, and fertility problems in women, hepatitis, even AIDS.</p>\n<p>This is a powerful medicine and should never be administered by anyone other than a highly skilled practitioner. On the day of treatment, patients are advised to have only a light juice breakfast and drink lots of water. The medicine is administered through small holes burned in the first two or three layers of the skin (typically be a series of small circles burned into the upper arm). The dried serum is mixed with water and a small amount is rubbed into each burn.</p>\n<p>Immediate effects include a stinging sensation and quickening of the carotid pulse. Patients may feel a flushing fever sensation in the arms and face, followed by weakness. Users should expect to vomit and experience stomach cramps. These effects subside within about 45 minutes, after which the patient should rest for the remainder of the day and enjoy a good night\u2019s sleep.</p>\n<p>In the week after administration of Kambo, people should be able to reduce or even eliminate medications such as pain killers, anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants used for chronic conditions, and no longer rely on narcotics. Side effects may include a few sweaty, restless nights. In sum, Kambo requires patients to endure about 45 minutes of discomfort in exchange for an extended period of painlessness during which the body can readjust with potentially permanent positive effects (i.e., end of chronic back pain, drug addiction).

People from many countries confirm that coming into contact with Sacred Plant Medicine and the SOUL QUEST TEAM is both an enriching and unforgettable experience.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Sacred Plant Medicine Sessions</p>\n<p>A \"session\" lasts 3-4 hours of process in which a dose of Sacred Plant Medicine is given plus an optional reinforcement dose offered approximately 2 hours later.</p>\n<p>Every Sacred Plant Medicine session includes the preparation beforehand and the subsequent psychotherapeutic integration the following morning.</p>\n<br>\n<p>All options include Integration work before and after the sessions, breakfast and lunch (made with organic products) and accommodation.</p>\n<p>The first session is taken at 8.00pm and the second between midnight and 12.00am, finishing the process at 2.00 to 3.00 am.</p>\n<p>To those who realize that they do not need to take that third session of Sacred Plant Medicine, we give the Sacred Plant Medicine fragmented to be taken in small doses during the days following the retreat.</p>\n<p>The choice of participation can be extended during the retreat itself whenever there\u2019s place available to do so.

Decriminalization of cannabis and even cocaine and heroin is not enough as that leaves the black market in place which still allows for unrestricted access to minors, predatory drug sales, violence, reduced but still continued mass incarceration of minorities (due to racial profiling and imprisonment of disadvantaged minorities who join the drug game but get caught at a higher rate than their peers who are not minorities), animosity towards police in urban communities, ruined lives due to childhood errors in judgement and lack of opportunity (due to a criminal record for those youth who sell drugs and are caught), etc. <br> <br>We will start by organizing activities to gather signatures for the 4 ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana as well as to register citizens to vote at various locations throughout Massachusetts (signature collection and voter registration tables at grocery stores, at concerts, etc.). I need help from those who are like minded and who are interested in voter registration and drug policy reform and activism. <br> <br>If you are new to this topic, books to consider reading would be The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander, High Price: A Neuroscientist's Journey of Self-Discovery That Challenges Everything You Know About Drugs and Society by Carl Hart, Our Right To Drugs: The Case for a Free Market Paperback by Thomas Szasz, Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs Hardcover by Johann Hari, Saying Yes by Jacob Sullum, and&nbsp;http://www.npr.org/2015/09/14/440327585/ta-nehisi-coates-outlines-path-to-mass-incarceration-in-the-atlantic<br> <br>Another idea would be to have some book club meetings to read some of the above books as well as others that are of interest to the members of this meetup. This is not so much a social group as a group that is dedicated to actual action. <br> <br>Let's start with reform around cannabis and after that is achieved let's start advocating for change around other drugs. &nbsp;Too many people are losing friends and family to prison and to drug overdose in our state.</p>", "created": 1442329638000, "country": "US", "join_mode": "open", "lon": -71.07, "visibility": "public_limited", "localized_country_name": "USA", "state": "MA", "score": 1713.0, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/Working-to-end-the-New-Jim-Crow-in-Massachusetts/", "members": 76, "timezone": "US/Eastern", "lat": 42.35, "urlname": "Working-to-end-the-New-Jim-Crow-in-Massachusetts", "organizer": {"bio": "", "photo": {"photo_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/1/6/1/member_249773601.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/1/6/1/thumb_249773601.jpeg", "id": 249773601, "highres_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/1/6/1/highres_249773601.jpeg"}, "id": 34991262, "name": "Mark"}, "id": 18934392, "name": "Working to end the New Jim Crow in Massachusetts"}

With so many distractions we are faced with daily, we can loose our sense of self and forget what really matters to us.</p> \n<p>In this space of distraction it is common to reach for soul nourishment by shopping, drinking, eating, gambling, sex and TV as a way of tuning out rather than tuning in.</p> \n<p>We have creating a space to tune in.

We are here on this earth to do big things and it is important to be grounded and empowered in our being</p> \n<p>When the focus in the material and drive we lose touch with our true hearts longing and look to unhealthy distractions to fill this void.</p> \n<p>It is time to integrate both of these worlds so we can be empowered conscious creators in our lives and the lives of others we are surrounded by.</p> \n<p>No more solo path of the lone wolf.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Time nourish our roots and our connection with the cosmos to be all that is possible.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;Steve and Corinne's passions gel in a big way. They love to build bridges and community with others looking to grow harmonic roots.</p> \n<p>We all have the potential to be powerful creators, we just have to choose to step into ourselves and be the conscious creators of our own life.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Harmonic Roots start within ourselves, in our homes and then spreads out into our communities. Steve and Corinne both love to dive into life and believe there is something bigger and more than what we see at play. The only limitations to what is possible is created in our mind.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Steve and Corinne have both faced adversity in their own way.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Steve grew up in Calgary trying to fit into a box that never felt right. He had a heavy dependency to cannabis and started stealing to support his habit. When he sat in the holding cell at the police station he decided to change his direction in life. He learned the carpentry trade and developed a thirst for knowledge. Eventually he embarked on a journey of self discovery to see who he really was. Steve Traveled to South America and Costa Rica Where he was opened up to Shamanism and studying Sacred Geometry. There Steve started to look into himself to see what had been holding him back from being happy and being himself. Soon after he stopped drinking alcohol and smoking Cannabis, a great sense of empowerment and leadership started to grow. After his return to Canada he started a personal mission to become a leader in which he could feel deep from within. Steve Now runs a Carpentry company and an in-home garden systems Company to empower families to grow their own food and bring back a sense of personal power into their lives. Steve is now passionate about sharing what he has learned over the years and see others start to truly step into themselves.</p> \n<p>Corinne Grew up in a home without an influence of what a healthy relationship looked like. What resulted was a feeling of shame around femininity, and a low self esteem. &nbsp;Corinne has always been highly sensitive and empathetic, she found it challenging to navigate life without the understanding that she easily felt what others feel. This lead into self destructive habits, future relationships and ultimately into a marriage she was trying to fix. If she felt if she could make others around her feel better, love her, she could feel safe and secure. After having her own children and choosing not to repeat the pattern, she started to make real changes in her life. She started to face her fears and look at what she could do to create a different life from an empowered space. So she could be an example for her children. Her children inspired her to step into herself and truly love herself so they could too, which has lead her to where she is today. She to no longer a victim and she chooses to live an empowered life and share her path with others.</p> \n<p>Steve and Corinne are real people who have made real so called mistakes in life. They have learned so much from these challenges and don't regret anything, because we learn best from our experiences. They hope to share by collaborating and hosting some amazing events based on their combined experience and passions to assist in creating awareness and expanding our web of creation and collaboration.</p> \n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p> \n<p>-Didgeridoo sound Meditations&nbsp;</p> \n<p>-Men's, Women's, Couples and Combined Women and Men Circles with intentions to empower, embody awareness and recognize the importance of our our interconnections.

The \"green rush\" is coming and there will be tremendous entrepreneual opportunities to capitalize on! We are more than promoting the legalization of recreational use of&nbsp;cannabis in California, we also meet up on hikes, 420 events, 420 parties&nbsp;etc. You can also&nbsp;volunteer with the 2016 Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA) which is the initiative in California that will be on the November 2016 ballot that will legalize cannabis for adult use recreationally. It's important that the facts, truth and science be known to everyone on the highly successful rollout of Colorado legalizing cannabis for recreational use 3 years ago. Here are some facts(please look these up for yourself). Teen use of marijuana in Colorado since recreational legalization has&nbsp;decreased 3.8%(source: colo dept of health.gov) and the federal government also has&nbsp;stated that teen use dropped 3% since recreational legalization in colorado&nbsp;as well(source:&nbsp;CDC&nbsp;Center of Disease Control and youth prevention website). Everyone said \"you legalize pot and all&nbsp;the kids will be lighting up\". This ridiculous&nbsp;propaganda has been proven wrong.&nbsp;JAMA internal medicine has reported that in states where marijuana is available, prescription drug deaths have dropped by 25%. Tax revenue generated&nbsp;was so significant in Colorado that they&nbsp;reimbursed every Colorado citizen $7.68 on their tax return(Colorado state law when the tax revenue exceeds a certain amount). DUI's are down. Pot arrests are down.&nbsp;Unemployment in Colorado is the lowest in the nation as a result of this new emerging industry. These are exciting times and you are in the middle of experiencing the emergence of a whole new industry. There is lots of money to be made and a lot of fun to have. Recreational legalization of marijuana is a cultural force that cannot be stopped!

(2) The more people who buy, sell and circulate Digital Currency, the more valuable it becomes, the more wealth we accumulate, and the more people we can help to become self reliant, financially free and sovereign.&nbsp; (3) We receive a referral fee for anyone who purchases an advanced Digital Currency Education Program.</p>\n<p><b>What Is Digital Currency?</b>&nbsp; </p>\n<p>It is our prediction that Digital Currency is the future of money and payments, and will topple the biggest industry in the world \u2013 banking and finance! </p>\n<p>Digital Currency, otherwise known as Cryptocurrency, the New Currency and \"Magic Internet Money\", is decentralized digital currency in which encryption techniques called cryptography are used for security and anti-counterfeiting measures to regulate the generation of units of currency, and verify the transfer of funds, operating on the Internet independently of a central bank or government. </p>\n<p>In its most simple form, Digital Currency is a type of currency, just like the Dollar or the Euro, that can be used to buy goods and services, exchanged for other currencies, and invested.</p>\n<p>Several notable US and international universities are now offering courses and degrees in Digital Currency costing up to $18,000, including: Stanford, MIT, Princeton, Yale, Cornell, New York University, Duke University, University of Michigan, Singularity University, University of Cumbria in Scotland, Canada's McGill University, University of Nicosia in Cyprus.</p>\n<p><b>Bitcoin -</b> The Digital Currency Exchange &lt;<a href=\"http://xcoinx.com\">http://xcoinx.com</a>&gt; lists the top 10 Digital Currencies by market capitalization.&nbsp; Bitcoin, arguably one of the best investments the world has seen, was the original Digital Currency in 2009.&nbsp; Bitcoin current market value is over $6.4 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>OneCoin -</b> Referred to as Bitcoin 2.0, OneCoin is #2 on the Digital Currency Exchange&nbsp;

You have probably already been to see the Midnight Sun, swam with the dolphins in California , done the tour around Cambodia or Lebanon, climbed Kilimanjaro, been to the Everest base camp or even done the Machu Picchu and are now wondering what next?</p>\n<p>Ekzoitika is Esperanto for exotic, the main\u00a0objective of this group is to seek out unique travel experiences,\u00a0far from the madding crowds, in places that are not on the popular tourist circuit.</p>\n<p>There will be one or two featured trips ever year for small groups of 6-8 people, in far flung places, in relatively unexplored areas. The trips may be hiking, four-wheel driving, motorcycle trips, trains, ships or any other mode of transport. The only thing common about these places would be that there will not be hordes of tour companies taking bus load of people to these areas every week.</p>\n<p>Eight of us have just returned from a trip to the flooded forest in the Brazilian Amazon, 420 miles from Manaus, spending most of our times in canoes\u00a0going deep into the jungle.</p>\n<p>Other trips that are on the cards include:</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0<strong>The unexplored Himalayas:</strong> Walking to the source of the Ganges</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0<strong>To the top of the world :</strong> From Kathmandu to Lhasa by Road</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0<strong>The explosive experience :</strong> Exploring the Volcanoes of Java</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0<strong>The Simple Life :</strong> Papua New Guinea \uf0d8</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0<strong>Meeting our Ancestors :</strong> See the Gorillas before they disappear \uf0d8</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0<strong>The Silk Road :</strong> Through the Heart of Asia to Mongolia \uf0d8</p>\n<p>\u2022<strong>\u00a0The untamed world :</strong> To the vast expanse of the Gobi Desert \uf0d8</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0<strong>To the end of the World :</strong> A is for Antarctica</p>\n<p>These trips will\u00a0be mostly self-guided tours, with\u00a0a lot of prior,\u00a0\u00a0pre-planning. We will use local tour companies and tour guides where appropriate but will avoid the more commercial ones like Exodus or similar, with the objective of making these a little easier on the pocket.</p>\n<p>Over the next 4-5 years we hope to cover many of the ones listed above. People interested would need to commit to the trips 6-12 months in advance.</p>\n<p>In addition to the featured trips, the group will provide a forum to exchange information, find travel partners and for people to share experiences. Members of the group will be encouraged to set-up their own meet-ups, which may include talks, exhibitions, book launches, or social evenings all broadly related to the groups travel objectives. Members interested in organising their own trips will also be welcome to do that, provided they are consistent with the objectives and guidelines of the group.</p>\n<p>While anyone is welcome to join the group, featured trips will be designed for active people who can handle a little rough travel in the wilderness, the target age group is 30 to 55, \u00a0younger or older people who are comfortable with people in this age group will also be welcome.</p>\n<p>The trips will be mid-budget range and the not\u00a0the rock bottom, low budget, sleeping in park bench type.\u00a0Accommodation will vary\u00a0from\u00a0basic hotels or even camping with a day of two of luxury thrown into the mix.

As the organizer of the group, I do not enforce standards of ritual at our gatherings, however, I do celebrate Sabbats and Esbats and if you would like to join me expect the rules of ceremony to be followed. Otherwise, you are free to celebrate in your own way. There is a balance in this world that is greater than you and me. It has been that way since time began and I don't see an interruption of that balance in the near or far off future. I don't have a pantheon of God's adorning my alter. I celebrate the God and Goddess equally but believe there are certain times when a God influence is called for and likewise for the Goddess. Balance is the key! As I am taking a chance and allowing you into my home, my sacred space, my refuge from a world gone mad...I simply ask that you have respect for me and my abode...in otherwords, you break it, you bought it!!!

The GVGT is the second Green Team to be formed, after the success of the Lower Mainland Green Team. Founded in 2011 by Lyda, the Lower Mainland Green Team has since grown to 1800 volunteers who have removed 71,420 pounds (about 7 elephants) and 870 cubic meters (about 4,000 bathtubs) of invasive plants, planted 6,600 native plants and trees and picked up 3,850 pounds of garbage, especially from shorelines.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Amanda Evans is the Program Manager of the GVGT and&nbsp;believes that fostering a connection between people and nature is key to taking care of our environment. She&nbsp;plans to motivate and encourage the community in the Capital Regional District to get their hands dirty and restore habitat.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/b/e/4/600_404756292.jpeg\"></p>\n<p><b>Regular Updates</b> <br> </p>\n<p>If you want to stay up-to-date with latest Greater Victoria Green Team happenings check out our Facebook Page &nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/greatervictoriagreenteam\">https://www.facebook.com/greatervictoriagreenteam</a>)&nbsp;and Twitter Page (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GVGreenTeam\">https://twitter.com/GVGreenTeam</a>)</p>\n<p>Check our <b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCf2MM0x2af-GAVRxAmZ-dQ\">YouTube CHANNEL OUT HERE</a></b></p>\n<p><b>Learn more about us by clicking on one of the link below:</b> <br> </p>\n<p>For a report of BOTH the Lower Mainland Green Team and GVGT click&nbsp;<a href=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/6/d/6/highres_432626326.jpeg\"><b>HERE</b></a> <br> </p>\n<p><b>We have been in the news!</b></p>\n<p>Goldstream News Gazette, December 3, 2015, <a href=\"http://www.goldstreamgazette.com/community/360450041.html\"><b>Shoreline students lend an outdoor hand</b></a></p>\n<p>Oak Bay News, September 25, 2015,<b> <a href=\"http://www.oakbaynews.com/community/329560011.html\">Trial Island pull puts Green Team to use FRONT COVER</a></b></p>\n<p>Oak Bay News, July 3, 2015,<a href=\"http://www.oakbaynews.com/news/311043451.html\"><b>Volunteers build fences for buttercups on Discovery&nbsp;(Page 3)</b></a> <br></p>\n<p>Saanich News, June 12, 2015,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.saanichnews.com/community/307661521.html\"><b>Volunteers of all ages pull together at Playfair&nbsp;</b></a></p>\n<p>Vancouver Sun, January 5, 2015, article about the LMGT and the GVGT <b><a href=\"http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Green+Team+takes+invasive+species/10701229/story.html\">HERE</a></b></p>\n<p>Goldstream News Gazette, October 31, 2014, <a href=\"http://www.goldstreamgazette.com/community/281020262.html\"><b>Planting trees for tomorrow's generations</b></a> <br></p>\n<p>Oak Bay News, October 16, 2014 Uplands Park article&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.oakbaynews.com/news/279492072.html\">HERE</a> <br></p>\n<p> Goldstream Gazette, September 10, 2014 news article&nbsp;<a href=\"http://issuu.com/blackpress/docs/i20140910091030825/1\">HERE</a> <br> </p>\n<p><b>Photos/Video</b> <br></p>\n<p>We may take photos and/or videos at the events.

By RSVPing \"Yes\", for Greater Victoria Green Team events, you acknowledge that you fully understand the nature of the activities, are aware of risks, and are sufficiently fit and capable of performing the activities, assuming all risks associated with those activities. All attendees hereby release and shall forever hold harmless the Greater Victoria Green Team organizer, all Greater Victoria Green Team hosts and other volunteers attendees and unconditionally waive any liabilities resulting from attending and/or participating in any Greater Victoria Green Team events. By attending our events you are taking personal responsibility for yourself and any minors in your care.&nbsp;Anyone under 12 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian.</p>\n<p><b>RSVP'ing and not showing up</b></p>\n<p>There are&nbsp;two rules:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;Because equipment, tools and refreshments are brought to each event based on the number of people coming, if you have RSVP'd to three different events (RSVP'd 3 times) and without notice have not shown up, you will be removed from the Greater Victoria Green Team. To \"un-RSVP\" go to where you had originally clicked on \"join us\" on the event page and click on \"change RSVP\".&nbsp;Please do this by the day before the event.</p>\n<p>2. If you don't show up to an event that has a restricted number of participants, and there is a waiting list for that event, you will be removed from the GVGT unless you have an appropriate reason. You must un-RSVP at least&nbsp;2 days&nbsp;before an event, especially if that event has a waiting list (to give other members a chance to take your vacated spot and participate). This ensures everyone interested in participating has that opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Groups we collaborate with</b></p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/\">BC

Members can count on the NCCC to make their voices heard. Only by creating professional standards and advocating pro-business policies that create jobs and invigorate economic growth can this industry reach it\u2019s potential. As NCCC leadership is actively engaged in every state, the pulse of the entire marijuana industry is the heartbeat of the organization.\n\nThe NCCC will highlight existing industry assets and advantages, focus on facilitating growth of jobs and demand for products & services, and coordinate statewide economic development efforts. By coordinating between policy makers and business owner needs, the vision of the NCCC is to ensure proper and knowledge-driven political representation on behalf of the growing business needs of the marijuana industry. Global market expansion can be achieved only by making the industry more attractive in the public arena and the best way to achieve this is by continually strengthening ties with legislative representatives.

See CA Proposition 215, SB 420 &amp; CA Health &amp; Safety Code11362.5, 11362.7.</p>\n<p>Medical cannabis (also referred to as medical marijuana) refers to the use of Cannabis (marijuana), including constituents of cannabis, THC and other cannabinoids, as a physician-recommended form of medicine or herbal therapy. Cannabis has a long history of medicinal use, with evidence dating back to 2,000 B.C.E.</p>\n<p>Although the extent of the medicinal value of cannabis has been disputed, it does have several well-documented beneficial effects. Among these are: the amelioration of nausea and vomiting, stimulation of hunger in chemotherapy and AIDS patients, lowered intraocular eye pressure (shown to be effective for treating glaucoma), as well as general analgesic effects (pain reliever). Less confirmed individual studies also have been conducted indicating cannabis is beneficial in a variety of conditions including Multiple sclerosis and depression. Synthetic cannabinoids are also available as prescription drugs in many countries. Examples include Marinol, available in Germany and the United States, and Cesamet, available in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and also in the United States.</p>\n<p>There are several methods for administration of dosage, including vaporizing or smoking dried buds, drinking or eating extracts, and taking capsules. The comparable efficacy of these methods was the subject of an investigative study conducted by the National Institutes of Health.</p>\n<p>While cannabis for recreational use is illegal in most parts of the world, its use as a medicine is legal in a number of territories worldwide, including Canada, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Israel, Italy, Finland, and Portugal. In the United States, federal law outlaws all cannabis use, while permission for medical cannabis varies among states. Distribution is usually done within a framework defined by local laws.

In our short time as an organization we have successfully educated the Vallejo City Council on the many benefits of cannabis, we were instrumental in passing the first successful referendum in Vallejo history. That referendum put a stop to an ordinance signed by the City Council that would have shut down all of the medical cannabis dispensaries in Vallejo for an undetermined amount of time and then would have reopened just four dispensaries that would have been handpicked by the Vallejo Police Department. After the success of that referendum the City Council sat down with the cannabis industry in Vallejo, as well as citizens of Vallejo and came up with a much better ordinance that grandfathered in the pre-moratorium, licensed tax-paying dispensaries. Together the patients of Vallejo have made a huge impact in our community. We wish the fight was over and the stigma behind using cannabis as medicine did not exist anymore but it does still exist, so our work is far from over. The VPC is committed to educating the community on the realities and benefits of medical cannabis.

Never before has the human species faced a challenge quite like that posed by the vastly diverse varieties of the Cannabis Plant. </p> \n<p>I don't see this as a competition but a diversification for the good of all involved, but for historical and clandestine reasons the recreational strains and varieties and ingestion methods are off to a big head start, an unavoidable and entirely fun effect of decades of effort by citizen scientist working entirely outside of the law, where high yields and recreational intoxication, appealing aroma and taste are the goals that must be pursued to guarantee survival of the old school clandestine grow. But the spectrum of the Cannabis experience is drastically more diverse than the variety of plants, products and therapies currently available.</p> \n<p>Simultaneous to the growing acceptance of recreational cannabis, there is a complimentary groundswell of a different nature starting to take form. Comprised not of cannabis doubters, but those that doubt we are experiencing even a fraction of the plants full potential as the current state of the Marijuanna art is still suffering from a lack of a Scientific *body of evidence* to support the efforts that growers and processors boldly dedicate themselves to on a daily basis. </p> \n<p>If you doubt my assertion, that the best among us are flying blind, I pose a metaphor. Have you ever eaten a sausage? If not, do you fully understand where it came from? Did you not have the stomach to even look? I would implore you to consider the fact that you should do it anyway. Well... having \"been there\" I can assure you that science, ALL science is the exact same way. If you have a sciencey sounding idea and you don't know where it came from, you're a customer, not a chef. Worse in the scientific area (which is fully accessible to everyone) it's worse... it's Junk Science, which is the worst cancer on any body of knowledge, where weed is no exception. </p> \n<p>So... with no book to look up the answer in, no special version of google or youtube to search... who, oh who is to step up and fill the gap? </p> \n<p><b>I'm literally asking. Which of you will step up?</b></p> \n<p>In a grand sense it sounds daunting... Honestly it even makes ME feel small ;-) But this is why nerds like to chop up big problems into an interlocking series of smaller ones and then put them all back together again like earth altering mega-legos. This is where you can lean on Mathew Gordon and myself, we pledge to provide free mentorship similar to that offered by a graduate school advisor to guide each of you that answers the call. </p> \n<p>For-profit non-profit and individual participants are equally welcome, and spectators are welcome as well. The only condition is that all projects that Mathew Gordon or I mentor will be presented to the group at large and documented via our dedicated Youtube channel. </p> \n<p>&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>", "created": 1433786320000, "country": "US", "join_mode": "open", "lon": -122.33, "visibility": "public", "localized_country_name": "USA", "next_event": {"yes_rsvp_count": 14, "utc_offset": -25200000, "time": 1462240800000, "id": "230186384", "name": "Medical Hierlooming Workshop Part 1"}, "state": "WA", "score": 1643.0, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/seed-to-bloodsream/", "members": 151, "timezone": "US/Pacific", "lat": 47.61, "urlname": "seed-to-bloodsream", "organizer": {"bio": "", "photo": {"photo_link": "http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/4/7/a/member_165005242.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/4/7/a/thumb_165005242.jpeg", "id": 165005242, "highres_link": "http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/1/4/7/a/highres_165005242.jpeg"}, "id": 124423212, "name": "Kavic Rason, M.S.M.E."}, "id": 18658238, "name": "Seed to Bloodstream: MMJ Mentoring"}

This is a brand new venture so please be tolerant/patient with me. As a Mom who uses cannabis I recently found myself in the position of meeting and networking with a lot of folks in the Cannabis Industry. I have a passion for advocacy and cannabis making this group feel like a natural move at this time.

I want to make that opportunity available to other Moms. For Moms who don\u2019t or feel they can\u2019t tell the people in their world that they use cannabis. We are here for you ladies, you are not alone. As for you Moms who are out and proud, good for you! You are an inspiration to Moms who live our lifestyle. Regarding me, I am a married Mom of four, legally medicating in San Diego, California. I am continuing my education, in life as well as in the Cannabis Industry, and want to share that information with other Mothers. For example; practical information that is relevant to being a Parent or Caregiver, exposure to new technology and products, incredible and interesting information about cannabis and the Industry itself, medical advances and even social events for fun!

Or <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/VictoriaTravelUniversity/join/\">Click Here</a>.</p>\n<p><span>This is a group for people who want to better understand how the world of Domestic and International Travel works, and more importantly, how to pay less when booking your own trip.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span><b>THIS SOUNDS SPAMMY (P.S. It isn't)&nbsp;</b></span></p>\n<p><span>The internet is a big dodgy place. We want to help you navigate through that without an e-book, or some other sales pitch. Travel Agents are a great resource if you have complicated itineraries. They can also help if you don't have time to arrange your own travel or to learn how to book yourself. But for people who put in the effort, it is 100% possible to book most, if not all, your itineraries online. If you have ever wondered how it all works and wanted to do it on your own, this group is how you can learn to do that.</span></p>\n<p><span><b>WHO IS IT FOR? WILL I BE TOO BORED/OVERWHELMED WITH THIS?&nbsp;</b></span></p>\n<p><span>Whether you are a world class Travel Hacker, a Grandma with an iPad, a Family who wants to travel, a mid-life-crisisee, or an aspiring backpacker, this group will be able to help you. We will hold weekly meetings on How things to do with Travel work, and how to use this knowledge to book your own trip at the lowest cost.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span><b>WHAT'S THE CATCH?&nbsp;</b></span></p>\n<p><span>There is no catch, we are a team of people who just love to Travel and want to share what we know. There may be some opportunities for paid services if you want more one-on-one help, but all of the weekly meetings will be free with a fully optional Tip Jar at the front (Australian Tipping rules apply - you can walk away and it's \"No Worries mate\"). The point is to demonstrate how you can use free tools on the internet to book travel as cheap as anyone else can.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span><b>WHAT WILL BE COVERED?&nbsp;</b></span></p>\n<p><span>Good Question! The Format is just like University.

You can Trust me!\". So why not come see for yourself, it's free anyway. However, if it makes you feel better, our team consists of people who have travelled, lived, and worked all over the world. You will not learn from a professor, or a Travel Agent, or some kooky holiday club trying to hock off their dodgy pyramid scheme. You will learn from everyday people who have got this system figured enough to travel on a shoestring budget to all corners of the globe through both filthy and luxury modes of transport. Most importantly though, you will learn from each other, a community of Travellers contributing to a common goal for exploration and adventure.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span><b>HOW DOES IT WORK?&nbsp;</b></span></p>\n<p><span>Think of a place you want to go to, bring a laptop/ipad/notepad, learn how to travel awesomely.

I started this club in Montana and profiled it after a club in Portland. Since I am relocating myself to Eugene this club will be following me to Oregon. As to my question, I don't know the answer to that BUT what I know is that I take as many hikes as I can that fits my schedule and my fitness level ( A guy's gotta put food on his plate first!) So what I'm going to do is schedule hikes and rides that appeal to me <i><b>and</b></i> then toss them out into this world to see if anybody wants to join in. <br></p>\n<p>And in case you are interested, I am modeling this Meet UP after the Endorphin Dripper Hiking and Cycling Club of Portland organized by Severt Lawyer. The events that I will hold will tend to be long-ish but moderate in pace. Severt Lawyer set up a culture of inclusiveness, tolerance, and a respect for Nature <b><i>AND THAT WHAT this</i></b> club is all about. So with that in mind, Most of the activities will start from a yet-to-be-dewtermined place in Eugene and around Eugene promote connectivity and ideals of sustainability. <br></p>\n<p>I will go at a speed that still allows for plenty of chatter and anybody that knows Severt and I knows that chatter is important. These hikes are 420 friendly only because it is the club's intent to respect Nature and all other Native constructs. However, with us in drought and dry conditions, only vapor will be permitted.</p>\n<p> Not only are we a club, we are a community. That means that we are here to encourage and support each other. The intent and objectives of the club are to compliment all other clubs and social organizations in the area. Competition, as a rule, along with Capitalism, in this context, is anathema to H.E.E.D.&nbsp; I am encouraging getting outdoors and leaving my checkbook behind and locked up in my desk at home. Reimbursement for gas will be as needed. <br></p>\n<p>Descriptions of the hikes that I will organize will TRY to accurately describe the difficulty level of each hike or ride in hopes that people will choose events that best fit their abilities. That is why I have asked you to rate yourself. <br></p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>Why did I chose 'Endorphin Drippers' as the name for this group? One was to emulate the culture and vibe created by Severt Lawyer and other Endorphin Drippers from Portland, Oregon. The second is endorphins function as neurotransmitters in the brain and are produced by exercise, pain, excitement, and orgasm. I can only guarantee the first three. Endorphins resemble opiates in their ability to produce pain relief and feelings of well-being and the effect has often been referred to as a \"runner's\" high. But the effect can occur anytime that people engage in any strenuous exercise or activity, not just running.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/a/e/9/600_434371465.jpeg\"></p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p> <br></p>", "join_mode": "approval", "who": "Hellraiser", "visibility": "public", "photos": [{"photo_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/9/9/f/600_434362943.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/9/9/f/thumb_434362943.jpeg", "id": 434362943, "highres_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/9/9/f/highres_434362943.jpeg"}, {"photo_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/9/b/0/600_434362960.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/9/b/0/thumb_434362960.jpeg", "id": 434362960, "highres_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/9/b/0/highres_434362960.jpeg"}, {"photo_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/d/0/a/600_438640202.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/d/0/a/thumb_438640202.jpeg", "id": 438640202, "highres_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/d/0/a/highres_438640202.jpeg"}, {"photo_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/d/8/2/600_438640322.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/d/8/2/thumb_438640322.jpeg", "id": 438640322, "highres_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/d/8/2/highres_438640322.jpeg"}], "group_photo": {"photo_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/8/6/600_434372646.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/8/6/thumb_434372646.jpeg", "id": 434372646, "highres_link": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/8/6/highres_434372646.jpeg"}, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/ED-Hikers/", "members": 72, "lat": 44.06, "urlname": "ED-Hikers", "name": "H.E.E.D. ~ Hellraising Eugene Endorphin Drippers", "created": 1423938052000, "country": "US", "localized_country_name": "USA"}

For me personally, I have found that consuming the right amount of herb can help me feel more \"into my body\" and present.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our classes will mostly take place at a venue called the Resin Club which is a cannabis association in the centre of the city. Occasionally when the weather is good, we will take the practice \"alfresco\" to the beach. If you're curious and have never tried incorporating cannabis into your practice then come along to one of our meetups and experience it for yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Namaste</span><br></p>\n<p>Matt&nbsp;</p>", "join_mode": "open", "who": "Yogis/Yoginis", "visibility": "public", "photos": [{"photo_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/2/e/2/600_435737122.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/2/e/2/thumb_435737122.jpeg", "id": 435737122, "highres_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/2/e/2/highres_435737122.jpeg"}, {"photo_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/0/d/e/600_439172990.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/0/d/e/thumb_439172990.jpeg", "id": 439172990, "highres_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/0/d/e/highres_439172990.jpeg"}, {"photo_link": "http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/3/d/9/600_439469657.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/3/d/9/thumb_439469657.jpeg", "id": 439469657, "highres_link": "http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/3/d/9/highres_439469657.jpeg"}, {"photo_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/9/b/600_440726011.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/9/b/thumb_440726011.jpeg", "id": 440726011, "highres_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/9/b/highres_440726011.jpeg"}], "group_photo": {"photo_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/3/c/0/600_447149632.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/3/c/0/thumb_447149632.jpeg", "id": 447149632, "highres_link": "http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/3/c/0/highres_447149632.jpeg"}, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/Yoga-for-healing-Body-and-mind-LEixample-meetup/", "members": 384, "next_event": {"yes_rsvp_count": 1, "utc_offset": 7200000, "time": 1461161700000, "id": "230200197", "name": "Cannabis infused yoga class (donation based)"}, "urlname": "Yoga-for-healing-Body-and-mind-LEixample-meetup", "name": "Ganja Yoga Barcelona", "created": 1422381824000, "country": "ES", "localized_country_name": "Spain"}

{"category": {"shortname": "Spirituality", "sort_name": "New Age & Spirituality", "id": 22, "name": "New Age & Spirituality"}, "city": "San Francisco", "who": "Members", "description": "Tantra is a form of yoga designed to enhance your experience of being alive. It  will help you to slow down, relax, and tap into your sexuality, your sensuality, your life-force energy, and your partner (if you're practicing with one), in radically new ways. This group practices spiritual sensuality, yoga, meditation, naked yoga, sexual-awakening yoga, and tantra, from a spiritual and heart focus. Tantra is a holistic spiritual system that connects the sexual and spiritual aspects of our selves, for integration, healing, joy, and power. We do not have an overt sexual focus, though we talk about how these practices improve sex, along with all aspects of life. You will feel immense relaxation, bliss, sensuality, and presence from these practices. I know, because I experience it every day. I help people find their bliss through relaxation, mindfulness, and sensuality.  I am a certified yoga instructor with over a decade of study and research into sexuality. I have been profiled in the New York Times and many other publications. I teach private relaxation-based hatha yoga, tantra and sexual-awakening yoga, ganja yoga, and clothing-free yoga. I also offer sexuality coaching and provide sensual, meditative bodywork experience and instruction. I work with individuals, couples, and groups of friends, privately and in public classes and workshops. My clients know me for being playful and accepting, and deeply-spiritual while solidly down to earth. Since 2009, I have worked privately with hundreds of couples and singles in the US, Canada, Europe, and Costa Rica, helping them to connect to their radiant embodied selves. I've impacted thousands of people through public classes, workshops, healing-arts parties, and speaking engagements. I've been living in the Bay Area since November 2012, and it's been my delight to continue to build a beautiful practice here!
