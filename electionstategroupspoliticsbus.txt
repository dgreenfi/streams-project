That referendum put a stop to an ordinance signed by the City Council that would have shut down all of the medical cannabis dispensaries in Vallejo for an undetermined amount of time and then would have reopened just four dispensaries that would have been handpicked by the Vallejo Police Department. After the success of that referendum the City Council sat down with the cannabis industry in Vallejo, as well as citizens of Vallejo and came up with a much better ordinance that grandfathered in the pre-moratorium, licensed tax-paying dispensaries.

The \"green rush\" is coming and there will be tremendous entrepreneual opportunities to capitalize on! We are more than promoting the legalization of recreational use of&nbsp;cannabis in California, we also meet up on hikes, 420 events, 420 parties&nbsp;etc. You can also&nbsp;volunteer with the 2016 Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA) which is the initiative in California that will be on the November 2016 ballot that will legalize cannabis for adult use recreationally. It's important that the facts, truth and science be known to everyone on the highly successful rollout of Colorado legalizing cannabis for recreational use 3 years ago. Here are some facts(please look these up for yourself). Teen use of marijuana in Colorado since recreational legalization has&nbsp;decreased 3.8%(source: colo dept of health.gov) and the federal government also has&nbsp;stated that teen use dropped 3% since recreational legalization in colorado&nbsp;as well(source:&nbsp;CDC&nbsp;Center of Disease Control and youth prevention website). Everyone said \"you legalize pot and all&nbsp;the kids will be lighting up\". This ridiculous&nbsp;propaganda has been proven wrong.&nbsp;JAMA internal medicine has reported that in states where marijuana is available, prescription drug deaths have dropped by 25%. Tax revenue generated&nbsp;was so significant in Colorado that they&nbsp;reimbursed every Colorado citizen $7.68 on their tax return(Colorado state law when the tax revenue exceeds a certain amount). DUI's are down. Pot arrests are down.&nbsp;Unemployment in Colorado is the lowest in the nation as a result of this new emerging industry. These are exciting times and you are in the middle of experiencing the emergence of a whole new industry. There is lots of money to be made and a lot of fun to have. Recreational legalization of marijuana is a cultural force that cannot be stopped!

</b>We have 3 motives for organizing this Meetup Group and offering our introductory FREE Digital Currency Mastermind Education Program.&nbsp; (1) Our mission is to educate the world and build a vibrant global community of like-minded visionaries, and empower them to live the good life of health, wealth, love and happiness, and help others do likewise.&nbsp; (2) The more people who buy, sell and circulate Digital Currency, the more valuable it becomes, the more wealth we accumulate, and the more people we can help to become self reliant, financially free and sovereign.&nbsp; (3) We receive a referral fee for anyone who purchases an advanced Digital Currency Education Program.</p>\n<p><b>What Is Digital Currency?</b>&nbsp; </p>\n<p>It is our prediction that Digital Currency is the future of money and payments, and will topple the biggest industry in the world \u2013 banking and finance! </p>\n<p>Digital Currency, otherwise known as Cryptocurrency, the New Currency and \"Magic Internet Money\", is decentralized digital currency in which encryption techniques called cryptography are used for security and anti-counterfeiting measures to regulate the generation of units of currency, and verify the transfer of funds, operating on the Internet independently of a central bank or government. </p>\n<p>In its most simple form, Digital Currency is a type of currency, just like the Dollar or the Euro, that can be used to buy goods and services, exchanged for other currencies, and invested.</p>\n<p>Several notable US and international universities are now offering courses and degrees in Digital Currency costing up to $18,000, including: Stanford, MIT, Princeton, Yale, Cornell, New York University, Duke University, University of Michigan, Singularity University, University of Cumbria in Scotland, Canada's McGill University, University of Nicosia in Cyprus.</p>\n<p><b>Bitcoin -</b> The Digital Currency Exchange &lt;<a href=\"http://xcoinx.com\">http://xcoinx.com</a>&gt; lists the top 10 Digital Currencies by market capitalization.&nbsp; Bitcoin, arguably one of the best investments the world has seen, was the original Digital Currency in 2009.&nbsp; Bitcoin current market value is over $6.4 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>OneCoin -</b> Referred to as Bitcoin 2.0, OneCoin is #2 on the Digital Currency Exchange&nbsp; &lt;<a href=\"http://xcoinx.com\">http://xcoinx.com</a>&gt;.&nbsp; By introducing the Aurum Gold Coin, it is the first-ever hybrid Digital Currency, backed up by solid gold and stored in Dubai.&nbsp; OneCoin is the only company to ever do over a billion dollars in revenue in its first year, faster than any other company in world history, and is on track to top Bitcoin by the end of 2016.&nbsp; OneCoin created 420 new millionaires in 2015, and is led by a truly remarkable international business woman, banker and economist, Founder and CEO, Dr. Ruja Ignatova.&nbsp; OneCoin current market value is over $3.7 billion.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/5/0/3/600_445730435.jpeg\"></p>\n<p><b>RSVP.&nbsp; </b>Limited seating available for each FREE Digital Currency Mastermind Education Program.&nbsp;

This is for those who believe in ending the New Jim Crow. &nbsp; <br> <br>This is also a group dedicated to statistical based arguments rather than hyperbole or sensationalism. <br> <br>Yes, heroin and methamphetamine are dangerous and very addictive drugs, but the drug war against them and other drugs cause way more social harms than the drugs themselves. We can look to progressive cities, states, countries such as Vancouver B.C., Colorado, Washington, and Portugal for inspiration. Decriminalization of cannabis and even cocaine and heroin is not enough as that leaves the black market in place which still allows for unrestricted access to minors, predatory drug sales, violence, reduced but still continued mass incarceration of minorities (due to racial profiling and imprisonment of disadvantaged minorities who join the drug game but get caught at a higher rate than their peers who are not minorities), animosity towards police in urban communities, ruined lives due to childhood errors in judgement and lack of opportunity (due to a criminal record for those youth who sell drugs and are caught), etc. <br> <br>We will start by organizing activities to gather signatures for the 4 ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana as well as to register citizens to vote at various locations throughout Massachusetts (signature collection and voter registration tables at grocery stores, at concerts, etc.). I need help from those who are like minded and who are interested in voter registration and drug policy reform and activism. <br> <br>If you are new to this topic, books to consider reading would be The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander, High Price: A Neuroscientist's Journey of Self-Discovery That Challenges Everything You Know About Drugs and Society by Carl Hart, Our Right To Drugs: The Case for a Free Market Paperback by Thomas Szasz, Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs Hardcover by Johann Hari, Saying Yes by Jacob Sullum, and&nbsp;http://www.npr.org/2015/09/14/440327585/ta-nehisi-coates-outlines-path-to-mass-incarceration-in-the-atlantic<br> <br>Another idea would be to have some book club meetings to read some of the above books as well as others that are of interest to the members of this meetup. This is not so much a social group as a group that is dedicated to actual action. <br> <br>Let's start with reform around cannabis and after that is achieved let's start advocating for change around other drugs. &nbsp;Too many people are losing friends and family to prison and to drug overdose in our state.</p>", "created": 1442329638000, "country": "US", "join_mode": "open", "lon": -71.07, "visibility": "public_limited", "localized_country_name": "USA", "state": "MA", "score": 2712.0, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/Working-to-end-the-New-Jim-Crow-in-Massachusetts/", "members": 76, "timezone": "US/Eastern", "lat": 42.35, "urlname": "Working-to-end-the-New-Jim-Crow-in-Massachusetts", "organizer": {"bio": "", "photo": {"photo_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/1/6/1/member_249773601.jpeg", "thumb_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/1/6/1/thumb_249773601.jpeg", "id": 249773601, "highres_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/d/1/6/1/highres_249773601.jpeg"}, "id": 34991262, "name": "Mark"}, "id": 18934392, "name": "Working to end the New Jim Crow in Massachusetts"}

Learn how to obtain a doctor's medical recommendation and unite for a common cause.</p>\n<p>Medical Marijuana, properly known as medical cannabis is an increasingly popular and legally sanctioned treatment modality for chronic disease. See CA Proposition 215, SB 420 &amp; CA Health &amp; Safety Code11362.5, 11362.7.</p>\n<p>Medical cannabis (also referred to as medical marijuana) refers to the use of Cannabis (marijuana), including constituents of cannabis, THC and other cannabinoids, as a physician-recommended form of medicine or herbal therapy. Cannabis has a long history of medicinal use, with evidence dating back to 2,000 B.C.E.</p>\n<p>Although the extent of the medicinal value of cannabis has been disputed, it does have several well-documented beneficial effects. Among these are: the amelioration of nausea and vomiting, stimulation of hunger in chemotherapy and AIDS patients, lowered intraocular eye pressure (shown to be effective for treating glaucoma), as well as general analgesic effects (pain reliever). Less confirmed individual studies also have been conducted indicating cannabis is beneficial in a variety of conditions including Multiple sclerosis and depression. Synthetic cannabinoids are also available as prescription drugs in many countries. Examples include Marinol, available in Germany and the United States, and Cesamet, available in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and also in the United States.</p>\n<p>There are several methods for administration of dosage, including vaporizing or smoking dried buds, drinking or eating extracts, and taking capsules. The comparable efficacy of these methods was the subject of an investigative study conducted by the National Institutes of Health.</p>\n<p>While cannabis for recreational use is illegal in most parts of the world, its use as a medicine is legal in a number of territories worldwide, including Canada, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Israel, Italy, Finland, and Portugal. In the United States, federal law outlaws all cannabis use, while permission for medical cannabis varies among states. Distribution is usually done within a framework defined by local laws. Medical cannabis remains a controversial issue worldwide.</p>\n<p>JOIN THE INTERNET PROTEST <br> Cannabis Cures Cancer - \"Run From The Cure\" - The Rick Simpson Story <br> When Rick discovered that the hemp oil (with its high concentration of T.H.C.) cured cancers and other illnesses, he tried to share it with as many people as he could free of charge.

&nbsp;Are you searching for open-minded, critical-thinking, non-judgmental and accepting new friends? &nbsp;\"Real\" people with integrity and transparency? &nbsp;Me too! &nbsp;I learned the hard way that trying to make quality friends is largely tied to your ability to find a \"tribe\" of like-minded people and for me that was open-minded rationalists.&nbsp; Open-ended general social groups are like trolling the ocean with a net - you get a lot of collateral catch.&nbsp; I've participated in (and led) other social Meetup groups and while I would occasionally make some good connections it was sporadic and only after having to suffer through a bunch of crappy ones first!&nbsp; I found a few rationalist/humanist type groups here on Meetup but they all seemed to be a bit more \"organized\" than what I was seeking. &nbsp;I'm not interested in anything highbrow or formal. &nbsp;I'm not interested in attending a \"secular outreach\" event - seems a bit too dogmatic to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor am I looking to lead/participate in any sort of activist activities.&nbsp; I'm just looking for like-minded folks to hang out/have fun with and hopefully call friends!</p>\n<p>Is this group for you? &nbsp;Absolutely not if any of the following statements offends you and/or doesn't resonate with you:</p>\n<p>\u2022 The official definition for faith is \"I don't fucking know but shut up and believe what I tell you\". <br></p>\n<p>\u2022 All religions are man-made brainwashing tools used by the elite few to control/exploit the uneducated and/or non-critical thinking masses. &nbsp;There is not a \"correct\" nor \"true\" religion. <br></p>\n<p><span>\u2022 There is no scientific reason to believe that any religious god(s) is/are more real than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny.</span></p>\n<p>\u2022 There is no scientific reason to believe \"Hell\" exists and it is simply another name for the pain and suffering we exact on ourselves and others during our life. <br></p>\n<p>\u2022 Agnostic atheism is not a religion and is the most intellectually honest position to take regarding the existence of the supernatural at the current time with our current knowledge. &nbsp; An agnostic atheist's position is \"there is no reason for me to believe in a god because the current information I have does not require it.\" &nbsp;They also don't \"hate\" god as it's impossible to hate that which one does not believe exists. &nbsp;Finally,&nbsp;agnostic atheism is&nbsp;not making an absolute statement regarding the non-existence of the supernatural; we simply \"don't know\". <br></p>\n<p>\u2022 Our nation was founded as a representative democracy and not a theocracy. &nbsp;Our national motto&nbsp;<i>\"In God We Trust\"</i> should be deprecated and replaced with our previous de facto motto&nbsp;<i>\"</i><i>E Pluribus Unum\"&nbsp;</i>(out of many, one). &nbsp;The \"under God\" phrase should also be removed from <i>The Pledge of Allegiance</i> (itself an archaic and fascist oath to statism but I digress).&nbsp; If you're a student of history you'll note that these changes were made in the 1950s during the second Red Scare by a Congress trying to placate the mostly religious populace by differentiating the United States from \"atheistic Communism\".&nbsp; <br></p>\n<p><span>\u2022 Religion and spirituality are not the same thing - religion dictates belief whereas&nbsp;spirituality&nbsp;does not.&nbsp;</span> <br></p>\n<p>\u2022 Buddhism is a philosophy and not a religion. <br></p>\n<p><span>\u2022 Organized anything (especially religion and politics) is generally a bad idea.&nbsp; Mobs don't think and they follow the leader over the cliff (remember Lemmings?)&nbsp;</span> <br></p>\n<p>\u2022 Carl Sagan and George Carlin are the closest thing to a modern day prophet but, please, let's not worship them!</p>\n<p>\u2022 Bill Maher is funnier than shit but you're laughing a lot of the time out of morbid recognition of our national stupidity and primitive ignorance.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Morality is subjective and its source is our humanity not the divine.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Prostitution should be legal and regulated (important for STD and traficking control). &nbsp;I hear the porn industry has a good testing model maybe we should use that. <br></p>\n<p>\u2022 Marijuana should be as legal to buy as alcohol in all 50 states. &nbsp;Which means Utah will have whacky Marijuana laws to supplement their existing nonsensical alcohol laws but one victory at a time! <br></p>\n<p>\u2022 Monogamy or non-monogamy (open relationships, open marriage, poly, etc.) - it's all good between transparent and consenting adults so go ahead and fuck whomever you want as long as it's legal. <br></p>\n<p>\u2022 Marriage only exists in reality and is an amendable legal agreement between two people.&nbsp;&nbsp; But seeing as we have only one shitty archaic and outdated model to choose from to get all those government benefits it's good that anyone can use it if they want, any way they want, until we can come up with something better. &nbsp;Marriage is also not an ownership contract - people aren't property, names don't change and rings are just jewelry.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Love is not a possession nor a prize to be won.</p>\n<p>\u2022 \"The One\" is named Neo - it's about the ones in our lives. &nbsp;Relationships are unique and valuable so don't throw them away; &nbsp;evolve them.&nbsp; <br></p>\n<p>\u2022 Authenticity and transparency trump conformity and a lack of integrity.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Your happiness is your responsibility. <br></p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<span>Learning or creating something is infinitely more interesting than Monday night football or crossfit.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u2022 When you boil away the bullshit all that remains is love. <br></span></p>\n<p>If you're still reading this then we might be the people you're looking for!&nbsp; All kindred spirits are welcome so come on in!</p>\n<p>P.S.
