The Cannabis and Hemp Association is an organization established in May 2014 to rapidly educate and provide networking opportunities to people interested in the miracle plant, cannabis. 
The CHA is focused on (3) initiatives:
1) Building Community-We give people with an interest in cannabis an opportunity to enjoy FUN and SAFE events in and around the New York Metropolitan Area.
2) Raising Awareness-Create media and exchange ideas to explore the latest news and discuss the history, people, places, and things involving cannabis.
3) Taking Action-Developing programs (such as this Meetup group) to further the acceptance of cannabis at the local, national, and global level.
  
We hope you will join as an Affiliate and consider becoming a Member. When you are a Member of the CHA you will officially align yourself with an organization doing positive initiatives, outreach, and a multitude of projects. As cannabis becomes more understood and further celebrated, having an association to a group can potentially be something of value when networking with others within the industry.

:::Cannabis Society of New York City:::
Members:842
These are not your typical events around art, culture, law, politics, and technology because we address these issues within the context of the cannabis/marijuana community. Counterculture icons will speak alongside political heavyweights and policy makers alike. Networking will be encouraged, connections will be made, and policies changed because of the events we hold. 
Events may have stand alone speakers, TED style talks, panels, or even debates. We will be creating local initiatives to decriminalize and legalize marijuana in the City of New York as well as creating committees to reach out to local authorities and community leaders to let them know about the needs of the local cannabis community. Get ready New York, the Times They Are A Changin.
Cannabis Society is a membership based non-profit social club corporation and we pride ourselves as being the first marijuana focused meetup in the nation dedicating our efforts to develop events around cannabis and its medicine, creative, commercial, and industrial uses.  We have chapters additional to NYC in Boston, Denver, and San Francisco.

A Voice for Responsible Marijuana Smokers
Since its founding in 1970, NORML has provided a voice in the public policy debate for those Americans who oppose marijuana prohibition and favor an end to the practice of arresting marijuana smokers. A nonprofit public-interest advocacy group, NORML represents the interests of the tens of millions of Americans who smoke marijuana responsibly.
Because NORML lobbies state and federal legislators, donations to NORML are not tax deductible.
During the 1970s, NORML led the successful efforts to decriminalize minor marijuana offenses in 11 states and significantly lower marijuana penalties in all others.
Today NORML continues to lead the fight to reform state and federal marijuana laws, whether by voter initiative or through the elected legislatures. NORML serves as an informational resource to the national media on marijuana-related stories, providing a perspective to offset the anti-marijuana propaganda from the government; lobbies state and federal legislators in support of reform legislation; publishes a regularnewsletter; hosts, along with the NORML Foundation, an informative web site and an annual conference; and serves as the umbrella group for a national network of citizen-activists committed to ending marijuana prohibition and legalizing marijuana.
Our sister organization, the NORML Foundation sponsors public advertising campaigns to better educate the public about marijuana and alternatives to current marijuana policy; provides legal assistance and support to victims of the current laws; and undertakes relevant research.
The oldest and largest marijuana legalization organization in the country, NORML maintains a professional staff in Washington, DC, headed by Executive Director Allen St. Pierre, and a network of volunteer state and local NORML Chapters across the country.

:::The Psychedelic Society of Brooklyn:::
Members:636
Welcome to the Psychedelic Society of Brooklyn! This is a group for those interested in helping to legalize psychedelics. (Check out our Facebook page here: https://www.facebook.com/PsychedelicSociety...)
The legalization movement will require an army of informed and passionate advocates who can help undo the damage done by decades of propaganda. Education is, therefore, central to our group’s objective, and to that end we will bring together scientists, historians, advocacy leaders, and public figures to inform the membership and the community at large. 
In addition, our society will cultivate an environment that encourages its members to produce intellectual material related to psychedelics and participate in local activism. While in today's landscape there are many groups and conferences geared towards education, the unique function of a psychedelic "society"will be a membership that pools its talents and resources to consistently release novel material that is relevant to the movement. The studies highlighted in the press serve an essential role towards ending prohibition, but there’s more to this movement than clinical trials and scientific studies. Our psychedelic society will foster a rich, interdisciplinary, and community-wide conversation that indirectly changes cultural and political attitudes towards psychedelics, thus shaping the inevitable post-prohibition world.
Welcome again and we look forward to seeing you at our events!
PLEASE NOTE: This is a group for those interested in helping to legalize psychedelics. To that end, we advocate and we educate. We do NOT engage in or promote illegal activities during our Meetups. Don't join this group to procure, or otherwise attempt to procure illegal substances or you will be removed.
