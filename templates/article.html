                          <h3>Colorado: 2014 Recreational Legalization</h3>
                            <p> Colorado passed Amendment 64 in November 2012. The amendment covered both
                              personal use of marijuana as well as retail sales. The first retail stores opened
                              on New Year's Day in 2014. Marijuana tax sales were almost as high as $1B for 2015.
                              Let's include a graph of month by month sales to show the growth of the industry. 
                            </p>
                          <h3>Washington: 2014 Recreational Legalization</h3>
                          <p>
                            Washington passed Washington Initiative 502 in November 2012. Sales began for the most
                            part in July 2014. We can show month by month sales as well for Washington. Maybe show 
                            the growth in the number of retailers by time.

                          <h3>Califonia: 1996 Medicinal Legalization</h3>
                          <p>
                            California passed Senate Bill 420 in 1996. They also voted on Proposition 19 in November
                            2010, which would have legalized Marijuana similar to Washington and Colorado, but the bill
                            did not pass. We can show a chart of the number of medical licenses that have been issued by year. 
                            It's a bit difficult to find year by year data on medical sales, but licenses would seem to be a
                            good proxy.
