<h2>Projecting the impact of 2016 legislation</h2>
<p>
  A lot of cannabis advocates are looking forward for a positive outcome of November 2016 ballot. The following is our projection of the most states 
  where it is highly likely to have legizlastion passed in the favor of the those voting for recreational legalization. 
  And if they do, what would be the expected projection of the year end sales collection. It should be noted that these projections are of the revenue generated by the Retail Marijuana Sales Tax (10%) for over a period of one year from the date it is legislated.
  
</p>
<p>We have calculated the expected tax collection
                          by the imposition of the Retail Marijuana Additional Sales Tax. Please Note: The total tax generated also includes an additional Retail Marijuana
                          sales tax = 2.9%. We  have purposely dropped this tax values as there was lot of inconsistency in the available data for tax collected
                          per county. The per county collection had been a key feature for our pattern evaluation.</p>
                          <h3> All Ballots Pass</h3>
                          <p> Here are the top four states where a positive result is highly likely. </p>

  <font size="2">Using the data available for Retail Marijuana Sales Tax (10%) for Colorado and Washington we calculated an average index for the two states. We calculated the index for the percentage of the popluation over 18 and use another data source that lists the percentage of poplation over 18 that used marijuana in the past month. Having calculated the index as an average, for each of the states we calculated the expected total revenue by following the process in the previous step in reverse order.</font>
